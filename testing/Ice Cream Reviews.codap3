Kong milk tea ice cream got a great aftertaste!  Our friend recommended this place, will spread the words and come back to try other flavors :)","Yum. Really. Try the Pistachio, it'll change your life. You may search the city for another one like it, and you will fail. You'll keep going back to Grateful Spoon, again and again, unable to get the taste of Pistachio gelato off your mind.","Cute little neighborhood spot for the locals to get our ice cream fix at hole it's still warm out. The service was fast and friendly and they did an excellent job decorating for fall. I can't wait to see what they come up with for next spring and summer. Though I do hope they decide to stay open at least into fall and offer hot chocolate. That would be a nice respite from the cold.","This place is pretty trendy and hip. Lots of people lounging and reading or working on homework. I can't speak for the food, as I haven't eaten here, but their drinks are pretty tasty. I sat down with a vanilla and almond Italian soda. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was yummy.\n\nI'd defiantly come back here. I am in love with trendy places like this. Next time I will get some food!","Love ice cream, love marshmallows, love graham crackers... had them all rolled into one dessert the campfire s'more in a serving size cup...pimpin mini in a cup. Long line up but for the first time we'll worth the wait.","So excited to have a Nekter in this location.\n\nStaff and owner were great, smoothies as perfect as always.  \n\nSmoothies, coolers, bowls all made fresh and to order. \n\nI'll be here a lot!","WOW! I cannot say enough good things about this place. The owner was by himself when we came and he worked crazy fast being friendly and nice to everyone who came in. He was busy and we still didn't have to wait long for our crepe and milkshake. Everything tasted AMAZING and it's all made in-house and absolutely delicious. Will be coming here again!!","I got a cone with the Peppermint and the Vietnamese Coffee and both flavors were exceptional! Both really large scoop portions. The homemade waffle cone was a little thin and bland but the ice cream was incredible. I also tasted the Olive Oil Ice Cream which I did not suspect to be any good and was actually insanely delicious!","Their acai bowls are awesome. I got the PB one and what I like about this place is\n1. They serve the acai bowls all day\n2. You can customize what goes inside and on top\n\nI just wish they had more size options. The bowls are beautiful but I find myself wasting about 1/3 of it every time and its not really something you can put in the fridge  for later. And for the price, I really don't like having to throw the excess away.","You can combine butter, bread, and meat on one plate and it taste great! The butter burgers are awesome, they are reasonably priced and the place is clean. What more do you want from fast food?","Awesome flavor, selection and quality of gelato. The staff are typically friendly and fast to help and keep the line moving. They lost 1 star because I feel more care should be taken when handling the gelato, they often dont use gloves and I see their bare hands often touch the gelato in the bins or cups. They will touch credit cards or other object that often contain microbes with their bare hands or gloves and then that will end up in the product you are consuming.","Place is hopping.  Very busy but the lines moves quickly.  Tried their cookies and peanut butter ice cream.  This was a great combination.  Parking was a challenge","A great little spot for a quick cup or a cold lager. Friendly and trendy with a nice cozy feeling for  a relaxing moment it's the best spot to take a break.","Absolutely loved this place!!! All the makings of an old school ice cream shop and to top it off, the ice cream is fabulous!!!! The experience and service is excellent!! Can't wait to go back!!!","The shaved ice I got was really yummy. This place gets really busy during the weekend nights and the seating is kind of awkwardly placed together. But other than that, this is definitely a nice place to get some late night dessert with friends!","I can't believe it's taken me this long to get to Sweet Jesus and I'm kicking myself for not going sooner but...better late than never! The staff are super friendly and the delish creations are well worth any line up! It's a must try if you love ice cream!! You won't be disappointed!","What a cute little water place!\n\nI don't come here to get water, but I stop by once in a while when I have the hankering for shaved ice. SO many wonderful flavors! And the shaved ice has the perfect texture - very important when you live in a HOT desert, right?\n\nThe owner is so sweet and her dog, Daisy (I believe is her name) is even sweeter. \n\nBeing an animal lover and a shaved ice lover - this place gets FIVE stars.","This place was hopping on one of the first Saturdays of the summer. The line moved quickly, though, and my crew left satisfied. Even considered getting back in line for Round 2...\n\nI recommend the gelato. And get a waffle cone; you won't regret it.","I love this little place! Delicious home made I've cream and sweet treats. They have expanded thier menu a bit, so now you can have dinner and desert! Lovely family owned small business.","The best ice cream in Phoenix hands down. Very good quality product along with friendly owners.","We came here for the first time and the service was amazing and the owner was so nice! He was super friendly, and super passionate about his shop. He also let us try everything we wanted and it was overall an exceptional experience! \n\nAlso, got the donut stuffed with ice cream. BOMB!","It is loud in there but clean and unique. They have lots of options with great tasting ice cream. What a perfect location.","Great customer service at this location.  I haven't tried anything bad. My favorite go to is the Turtle but I love trying all the seasonal items","Had S'mores and strawberry shortcake sundaes and it was super awesome.... Staffs were super cool and friendly... Can't wait to have s'mores again.","I just want to say that the Snappers these guys are now selling are delicious.  I have not been to the restaurant. I live in Paradise Valley Arizona.  But at Costco I just picked up their newest creation.  Snappers.  OMG the best.  If you like salty and sweet, chocolate and carmel, you will love love love Snappers.","I ordered an extra large ice cream sandwich for my bf's birthday. It was amazing, every one of our guests polished their plate and asked for more. \n\nThe ice cream sandwich needs to be ordered at least a day in advance and they prepare it the day of.","Best shaved ice in town! The only down fall today was the guy at the register today had like an attitude today or something. I didn't get his name but he had tattoos and an LA hat on. Other than that the taro snoh was really good. Also, i had a strawberry iced tea. Great after taste.","Not your usual shaved ice and boba tea... the looks of the food definitely threw my party off... but absolutely delicious once you got going!!","Very classic ice cream shop look. They have plenty of flavors and lots to look at!","Known for butter burgers and cheese curds, I came to Culver's tonight for their fish sandwich... And cheese curds! \n\nThe curds were gooey good and the fish was a fairly substantial piece of cod. Not only impressive but delicious. But the food was outdone only by the sincere courtesy of the young people serving. As I write this I'm asked by a smiling young guy asking if he can take my tray and garbage. \n\nService with a smile and good food. Top marks!","Yummy delicious mint chocolate chip and chocolate chip ice cream! They use shaved chocolate chips, which are my favorite. We met the owner and he was very friendly. We will definitely go back!","Love this place. It is not just about the ice cream, but all of their flavors are amazing, it's walking in the door and having instant flashbacks to my childhood. It's a must try place in Phoenix and absolutely love treating myself to some Churn. Churn baby Churn","Went for the first time over the holiday weekend! What great flavors to choose from and the staff was friendly too!! A delicious way to cool off this summer! We will be back!!","Taro with boba. Best dessert ever! Need to go 24/7 cause I'm always craving it. Fun place to go and hang out with friends outside of the bar scene.. it's every big child's dream","MacAlpine's has sat in the same exact location near downtown Phoenix since 1928. As far as I can tell, that's longer than any other establishment in the Valley. The cookie dough shake I had was delicious. It's not hard to forget you're in the 21st century the moment you walk in, since the only thing you'll find inside that's less than several decades old are the waitresses.","I LOVE THIS PLACE. I've lined up many times and I would do it again. I love their Fruity Loops and Key Lime Pie ice cream in the Hong Kong waffle and puff. It does get crowded once you're inside waiting for the waffle (they make it fresh) but it's worth it. The only other thing they could use is more seating as walking and eating ice cream sandwiches can get quite messy...still delicious either way!","One word - fantastic! How will I ever eat breyers again? You can tell it's homemade with real ingredients and the prices are fabulous! Highly recommend the strawberry. The portions are large and it's on a popular street. I'll be back!","Great ice cream and it's so fun to watch them make it! I always get the traditional dairy base but my boyfriend who's lactose intolerant gets the cashew base and you almost can't tell a difference! Love coming here on date night!","Unko always hook it up!! We're from Oahu, Hawaii and so is the owner. We moved here a couple years ago and this place makes us feel like home. This is the only Hawaiian shave ice place in Arizona!!! Come check this place out. We plan to come here every week","Millie's is clean, has friendly employees, and of course awesomely yummy flavors of ice cream. Can't wait for the second location to open! And don't stop selling in stores...","The girls there are the nicest people imaginable. You can try any flavor you like. Best sorbet/ice cream/etc place in Phoenix. \n\n\nMust go.","This review is for the salted caramel truffle blizzard only.  This location, compared to all other locations I've been in the Pittsburgh area, does a FANTASTIC job with this particular blizzard.  I don't know what they do, but it's so much better than any salted caramel truffle blizzard made by any other location by a landslide.  More chocolate?  More truffles?  I don't know, but kudos to whoever has the heavy hand at this Dairy Queen.","You come here for the experience! Soft serve ice cream with tasty bits of whatever. Everyone is taking photos of their creations to put on social media. I tried the birthday cake. Delicious. Couldn't finish 1/2 of the regular size. I'd say opt for the kid size. Very fun to try while in Toronto!","Burgers, shakes, and soft serve ice cream. What's not to like. This isn't a 5 Star Wolfgang Puck restaurant, it's Dairy Queen. Good food at cheap prices. Restaurant could use some updating, but when it's hot, this is the place to take the Kids for some good soft serve ice cream and grab a bacon cheeseburger for dad. What more can we say.","This place is an awesome place to go to with friends; I love the tea and yogurt!!!  Highly recommend it!","Fun place for a sweet treat! The menu has a great variety of options to customize the desert to your liking. And it is a (cool) blast watching it be made. They use liquid nitrogen, so the base goes from a smooth liquid to a chilly ice cream consistency. \nYou should definitely check this place out!","We had a stop in Phx and the only place I had bookmarked in Phx was this ice cream place. Very glad we checked this place out. The service was amazing and they were super helpful!\n\nI got the cookie ice cream sandwich and the cookies were nice and soft. They allowed us to test taste a few ice cream and I chose Cookie and mint. Delicious. \n\nThey had some interesting ice cream flavors so make sure you try them! Very cute store and amazing service!","Just excellent. We got there right as they opened and only had a brief wait. We ordered an oatmeal and London Fog sammie and a waffle with burnt toffee and what the fudge chocolate iced cream. It was all amazing. If you're trying to live that no regrets life, get the waffle for sure. Overall, great place and would recommend this to anyone with a sweet tooth!","Butch has great customer service. The pops taste amazingly fresh. The facility is very clean. I think it is awesome to support our local businesses.  If you bring 5 books to donate you can get a free pop!","I scream, You Scream, We All Scream Ice Cream\n\nThis venue is virtual heaven for the ice cream lover. I visited and was in a state of shock with the choices available. This is my fave ice cream destination.","We order delivery often and the service is always prompt and we love the pizza. And they take credit cards!","This place is so so so amazing. We stop every time we drive down from Sedona and it's a stop I look forward to. If you're looking for good boba in northern Phoenix area you've got to go here!","It was our first time getting rolled ice cream after a year of watching videos online about it. There aren't too many places in Phoenix that have it, so we were very pleased with our choice! It's by the door of the south east entrance. Cute little shop, with a lot of variety. We got vanilla ice cream, oreo-rocher love, wafers and toasted marshmallow, with white chocolate syrup. Delicious!!! Great pricing for the amount you get.","Our go-to dessert in Phoenix! I can't say enough good things about this place. The service is excellent and the owner is passionate about their quality products. I recommend the dough melt, the artisan ice cream and specially baked donuts make all the difference. I'd had donut ice cream sandwiches before, but nothing this good. They'll let you try all the flavors you want, so you're guaranteed to get something you like!","I'm always happy with the price! Plus, they're open late. And their cookie dough bites seem to better than others....","Great Ice cream, tastes just like the one in NYC, very creamy but I did notice they didn't have the same flavors. Great experience and delicious ice cream, worth the stop if you're in the area","Love this place, it's not too rich and you can make whatever assortment of flavors and toppings you'd like.  My daughter (who's 3) always loves to go to the ice cream shop as she calls it. Never had a bad experience here and it's always well priced.","Wow!! I've been dying to try these for a while, especially considering they are lactose-free for my lactose-intolerant self. Surpassed my expectations! I got mine from Commonplace Coffee at Mexican War Streets. Blueberry ice cream on oatmeal lace cookie. It was divine! The cookie was soft, not frozen. And the ice cream was softened so it was easy to bite into. They have a great selection of very unique flavors and combinations!","So good, not just your basic vanilla ice cream. All home made ice cream and you can tell when you taste it, they are also super nice here! Reccomend the salted caramel!","Our family had our minds blown by the AWESOMENESS that was found here!  Never tasted waffles like this before.   the ice cream w as also out of this world. Made an excellent impression on us our of towners","I scream, you scream, we all scream for... Custard? You get the point.  Mmmm Mmmm Good!","We tried sweet Jesus for the first time last weekend. The ice cream was really good. I had the brownie and it was delicious. It was very busy and the space was not big enough for the crowd. I found it very tight with people. Also, the staff were not friendly at all. They did not even smile the whole time I was there. \nHowever, the ice cream was really good and I would return again for the yummy ice cream.","In my opinion, there are only two places in this town to get ice cream: Sweet Republic and Churn. Otherwise, save yourself the calories. You're welcome.","Really good ice cream. I got the peanut butter one because they said it was the most popular one. My friend got vanilla and loved it. I loved mine too... but literally after two mins I DROPPED IT ALL ON THE GROUND. :(((. Anyways it was really good. RIP","Good spot, with alot of flavors. The bars are beautiful, and the store is also nice inside. The ice cream taste super good, flavors taste just like what the flavor is, not artificial.","This place is absolutely delicious! We arrived right before closing and as much as I hate being \"those people\" we were greeted warmly and given a brief run down of the goodies. \n\nI tried some of the candy bark, chocolate covered pretzels and a chocolate milkshake. \n\nEverything was heavenly! So good!!! \n\nI'm just glad I don't live closer because this place would be terrible for my waistline. \n\nIf you're in the area, do yourself a favor and get here!","Very good donuts and boba. I want to go back everyday but I don't want to be creepy haha","Not an ice cream person but my boyfriend is a die hard ice cream fanatic! It is really good ice cream and frozen yogurt. You get a lot of ice cream for what you pay.","I got the halva ice cream in a ginger cookie...This is the BEST ice cream I've ever had. It even beats out the Bi-rite Creamery in San Francisco! The ice cream is dense and heavy--the way ice cream should be...The cookies were soft and fresh, even 15 minutes before close...and there was still a line out the door! The staff were still friendly polite and patient. 5 Stars all around!","A very interesting choices of gelato. Not sure if I've seen those choices anywhere else. Imagine: pear+white wine, kefir+lime leaf and peach+sage. I got myself a ricotta+rosemary.. Definitely worth to try. On top of all those yummy gelato, they also have a good espresso and a cozy place to hang out.","Snow is not Shave Ice. We love that Hawaian treat, but this is better. Drier, even fluffier, it is the perfect medium for creative toppings. There are lines, they move fast enough, but you may be challenged to find a seat. As with save ice, we like to top with evap milk and fruit, but there are dozens of intriguing alternatives.","Heavenly high soft serve, canvassed with game changing toppings and sauces. Sweet Jesus is certainly a holy blessing but also blasphemy to your hips. I'll take a second coming any day at Sweet Jesus.\n\nFull REVIEW here http://tylerbaron8.wixsite.com/beastandfeast","I think we might be back!\n\"Ice cream donuts from Heaven\" says thirteen-year-old Braeden","So glad I decided to check this place out! So delicious and would definitely recommend! They have so many different options to choose from and the staff was quite friendly.\n\nThe only downsides: parking, lack of indoor seating, and 3-4 items on the menu were out :(","Really well-crafted milkshakes. My spouse enjoyed her salted caramel milkshake. I really loved the non-dairy coffee milkshake (almond milk) and I really appreciate it - I don't see almond milk based ice cream / milk shakes all that often.","Amazing!!! In an ice cream world of cold stone and brusters, there is a place that still cares about making amazing ice cream. \n\nHad the cookie dough. The vanilla alone was insane. So fresh and creamy, and they LOAD it with cookie dough. \n\nI cannot recommend this place enough and will certainly be back here","Hands down, Mineo's has the best pizza in Pittsburgh, if not the country.  \n\nThe pizza is perfect, with a thick layer of cheese and a thin crispy crust.  I dig the pepperoni the most, as its baked under the cheese and combines perfectly with it.  Their sausage is also mad good.  \n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh, stop here.  You don't even need to go anywhere else.","Omg amazing.  Had the dulce de lece, chocolate and coffee.  So creamy .  The fellow who runs the place is lovely.","Seriously the BEST icecream parlor I've ever been to! Try the homemade macaroons with strawberry icecream. ....ridiculously amazing!","Salted caramel shake was awesome. Their flavors are really good. The mayan chocolate with chilie was great.","I'm a huge fan of Snoh!! They have great variety of flavors and they're all so delicious! I love the taro, black sesame, and Thai tea snohs.","Yum! Hubby & I went in today around noon. Doughnuts taste like they use high quality ingredients and are very good. The donut holes are light and airy delicious. Prices are good too. We live close by and used to travel pretty out of the way to go where we used to. Lucky has our other place beat, hands down.","It's too bad that individual toppings aren't allowed to be added to scoops, they're only to be added to shakes and concrete mixers. Don't really understand that but these custards are very smooth thick n creamy. Very yum. Especially the rich chocolate! They even offer mini vanilla cones to dogs! \n\nPlease aim misters towards the benches! Will come back.","I am a fan of frozen treats. The G-spot is always satisfying. :-D  The folks behind the counter are always helpful. No matter what flavor you try it always surpasses expectations.","The establishment is very small with really no seating so this is a definite take out place. We went across the street to sit on a bench to ear our ice cream. The ice cream was great. It was smooth and creamy. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed. Even though there are lines the service is quick. The staff is very friendly and helpful","We visited this place on our visit to Arizona and we would come back every week if we didn't live in the area! The quality of ice cream is so amazing and the flavors we're so refreshing. On top of all that the ambiance has that local, friendly vibe with a very friendly staff!","Variety of drinks  on menu I tried the watermelon slush and added mint. Next time Im going for ice cream. Customer service was quick and friendly.","This ice cream is so good. I was hesitant about what I ordered since it was so different than my normal plain Jane ice cream I get, but it turned out to be great. I ordered the Cookie Monster which has dark chocolate shaved pieces, blue chocolate sauce and Oreos with a little cookie stick picking out of it. The  cream is poured on a cold surface and then rolled into little ice cream rolls. It's a nice rich flavor. Soooo good. Will try this place again.","Very fun and a nice new take on an ice cream treat.  Doesn't beat a top notch ice cream or Gelato, but a fun new concept.  I got a medium cone dipped in a salted carmel shell and rolled in pecans - yum!","I loved it here! I got a slice of the Chili-Mac and Charlie and the BBQ Buffalover. The BBQ Buffalover was soo good. I also tried the Mozzarella sticks and the Jalapeno poppers. Both were amazing as well. Definitely recommend getting them as an appetizer or snack. 10/10 recommend this place.","Mmmm all their flavors look delightful. I got the Java Jolt shake. We had a Babe Council event here today partnered with UBS. So we had sweet treats & donated blood. Boss Babes! They make their own marshmallows! Wow!!! I'm now on a sugar high!","You can definitely taste the matcha in the tsujiri soft cream  there's not a lot of space so take out and eat while you walk","This is my first time here at thirdspace. And the first place to catch my eye was the novel ice cream shop. So right after I finished eating my meal I headed straight over there and was greeted by Jennifer and Brandon. They were awesome and they really took the time to explain what they had and really toon into consideration that it was my first time and walked me through the process of the Stuffed Doughnuts. And seriously they are absolutely pieces of heaven.","Interesting to watch as they make your order.  Three stations making orders and the staff work hard to make your rolled ice cream.  Ordered the Very Berry and Cherry.  Fresh ingredients and tasty ice cream.  It does take a while to make your order and luckily the line was short so our wait was not to long.  Definitely a good and interesting take on ice cream, but for $7 it is a little on the expensive side.","They have all five star reviews here for a reason...it's fantastic! The yogurt and toppings are delicious and I LOVE the customer service/loyalty program they offer here...that's why we come back over, and over, and over again...","My wife and I love their ice cream and the workers are very kind. We always feel very welcome and the ice cream is incredible - very fresh and flavorful. We've probably been here 20+ times and the experience has always been consistent.","I love this cute little cafe in Shadyside! They have an amazing Iced London Fog drink, which is essentially Earl Grey tea with milk and cinnamon dusted on top. They also serve a nice selection of ice cream, which they source from Dave & Andy's. I've also brought work to do here before because they have free wifi. I would definitely recommend this cafe!","This is my go to place for pizza. I love the flavor of the cheese . This is what I do when I get my pizza. I sit and wait for 10 mins or more so the cheese can cool down and harden. After that I take slow bites and enjoy the goodness.","LOVE!! That is the only way to describe how I feel about Zoyo.\n\n- Love: outdoor seats with giant heaters to keep you toasty while eating cold goodness\n- Love: all the flavors, especially the super simple but perfect vanilla\n- Love: the toppings, which are fresh, delicious, and seasonal (holiday gummi bears!!)\n- Love: pricing, which is very reasonable for what you get\n\nCan't wait to go back!","Haven't been here much since winter started but before November I would come here with my roommate every humpday Wednesday to get froyo as a stress reliever. There are so many amazing flavors here, whether you are in a mood for more creamy or fruity flavors. I also love the toppings they have. The fruit toppings are always fresh.","Long wait for this icecream but it was worth the wait. Massive ice creams with impressive menu to choose from. It's located close to the huge \"Toronto\" sign which makes for good photos.","WARNING: Addictive!\n\nSimply, LOVE it!  Macaron adds texture + dimension to the normally boring, almost soggy, grocery ice cream sandwiches.\n\n\"Patience is bitter, but it's fruit is sweet.\" -- Aristotle\n\nThe portable sundae, as I call it, is bitable while melting on your tongue.\n\nChunky PISTACHIO ice cream is elevated with MACARON.  Perfect crunch + texture!\n\nThe SIZE of Macaron Ice Cream is w.o.r.t.h.y!","Amazing ice cream just loved it. Celebrated hubby birthday with something delicious after lunch  definitely return. Very friendly staff and very helpful.","My fiancé and I thoroughly enjoyed our milkshakes. At the recommendation of the staff he tried the friend ice cream milkshake and I had the peanut butter brownie. Both were excellent!","Oh my goodness! What a gem. I had the dough melt with sweet cream and honey. Whoever thought of using a donut for an ice cream sandwich is a genius. Best dessert I've had in Phoenix. Love the small and fresh batches of ice cream, which when paired with a warm donut is heavenly. Great service from the owner's too. I will be back again.","Super tasty ice cream and super friendly staff! We were encouraged to try multiple flavors before making our selections  - awesome! 10/10 would go back.","Cool little place to hang out. Tea, boba, diamond bar/ice cream, decor, customer service are outstanding.","Found in the heart of Little Italy, Dolce Gelato has really good gelato for about $3 - $5. My friend and I went twice in the same night in a span of 4 hours. I would really have to recommend the limone gelato - it's awesome!","Wow! Not only did I have an AWESOME first time experience but the cupcakes AND service were great as well! The woman working was very kind and explained the rewards system as well as favorite flavors to me. The place is very cute and clean inside. And the cupcakes are HUGE for their price and delicious!","Amazing matcha place and I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Toronto to try! Their soft serve matcha ice cream is a good blend of bitter and sweet, though the parfait is better since the red beans balance out the bitterness of the matcha ice cream even more. They also have cute tatami mats inside that can seat four!","Best pizza I've ever had ! Also so impressed with the poutine that I had to get it again. I look forward to trying everything on the menu.","Delicious ice cream and charming little place. Snapper milkshake is the perfect blend of salty and sweet.","My favorite flavor now is the Peanut Butter Crunch! The best part is that there's only something like 2.6 grams of fat per scoop. Hard to believe! Ymmm! This is our favorite place to go when we visit family in Arizona!!","Just left & I want to go back already. The ice cream was like real ice cream it was delicious down to the Nutella  I would go back to try something new but this strawberry cap n crunch boi","My kid and partner adore the ice cream here. They always find something they are interested in, and the texture is always nice. I think the customer service rocks. Cons: I had the mango sorbet once and it tasted bad, and far too sweet. I had to throw it aways part way through because it just tasted so terrible to me. However, since everything else that everyone else has had was a hit, I still recommend it, even if it isn't for me.","Picked up healthy breakfast smoothies the evening before...kale, water, banana,  mixed berries,  chia, and flax.  Pleasantly surprised by the $1 off coupon on my receipt! Sweet sraff!","This place rocks! \nIt is connect to my favorite Pho restaurant, Pho Thanh!\nThey have such an awesome variety of drinks, smoothies and ice cream.....so many to choose from and not just your local normal vaiety of Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry, but I'm talkin tropical flavors and not so tropical flavors!\nWhen in the neighborhood come check them out!!!\nLove them!!","Such a strange concept for me. We ordered a rainbow roll and the tres quesos roll and much preferred the rainbow roll because of the strong panko flavoring on the latin roll. The drinks are strong, and when I say strong, i mean STRONG! This place can get busy so expect a bit of a wait. Service is hit or miss. I am told that the carne asada roll is the way to go so we will be back to try that.","Great pizza and staff! Always recommend  would choose pepperoni,  buy other toppings just as good.","If you like PB & chocolate ice cream w/ salted caramel, nuts all in one place try the \"kitchen sink\" omg !\nGreat atmosphere on the shady back patio !","Awesome! Food was excellent. I got the Culver's Deluxe and it exceeded my expectations. Even the fries were above average. They didn't have that generic taste that a lot of fast food places have. Just be prepared to pay a little more than you would at other similar places like In-and-out or Jack in the Box. We got 5 combo (\"basket\") meals for about $38.","What a great little shop. They make their own waffle cones, and you can watch them getting canisters of ice cream ready at the counter. When you enter, the scent is amazing. The line is worth the wait.\n\nThere are the standard flavors and then monthly specialties. We got waffle cones and cups. But toppings are also available.\n\nDefinitely worth a stop. It is more than just the ice cream. It is an experience.","They make cupcake and ice cream sundaes. The cupcakes are very moist. They must use some witchcraft to make them. The ice cream was good. A sundae is plenty large enough to share between two people.","This place has an excellent menu and the chia cups are so delicious! Everyone is very friendly and the place is always clean.","I only tried the original flavor which was the one of the best even the texture was perfect. Also,  good that it opens late.","I am impressed about this Macaron with ice cream.  I ordered a small one for the price of little over $3. I think it's little pricey for a small Macaron but I have to say it tastes really good. I do recommend.","Delicious! And the ice cream is made from grass fed cows?! What whaaaaaaat! We really enjoyed our ice cream here. The flavors are clean, the prices good and the sizes are reasonable (not ridiculously huge). I feel like I had just the right amount of ice cream to be refreshed and not engorged. The smallest size was perfect for my 3 yo. I would definitely come here again! Great local find!!!","Found this place by looking up crepes near me and so happy I tried it out. I got the Nutella with strawberries crepe which was pretty good! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes crepes. The staff was friendly, the place was clean.\nOnly downfall that it can be easy to miss because it's surrounded by abandoned stores in a dead plaza.","This ice cream shop is REALLY good. I had the toasted marshmallow on a sugar cone, and it was crazy-good. Apparently if you get the waffle cone, you find a surprise at the bottom - Melted marshmallow! Wow! I didn't get the waffle cone because it's just way too big for me, but the idea of marshmallow instead of solid, cold chocolate at the end of the cone sounds wonderful... Will definitely be back!","This is one of our favorite ice cream places in Pittsburgh! Everything is delicious! EVERYTHING!!!!  Only downside is that they only accept cash, oh and they aren't open year round!","This place is sooo good they have all the traditional Filipino foods that I love. They have the best Palabok and halo halo!!! But the palabok did take some time, I recommend calling ahead and then picking it up if you don't want to wait so long. The palabok was $9 and the special halo halo was $5.","My wife and I recently moved to Arizona and we've been searching for a decent boba shop. Glad to say this place meets our expectations. Sad that they'll be closed soon but looking forward to the new location :)","Pops are so yummy and theres a student discount here :) love the atmosphere  \nTried the green thai tea with boba (green) which is great with half ice/sweet, just a bit pricey $7, but with student discount & yelp check in for boba it was $5ish","I love Rialtos! It's my favorite pizza place. I get their xtra large cheese pizza delivered to my work all the time.","Great ice cream.  So many flavors and toppings with several cones.  The parking lot is hard to get in and out if the line for the drive thru is long.","This is by far my favorite ice cream place in town. It's a super clean shop and the ice cream is amazingly delicious. You won't regret trying this place!","Not that bad ！ nice decoration ！like the teddy bear will be back next time。I order two bingsu both is ok just nothing special~~ the price is little bit high","Came in after a night at Teharu and this place was poppin'. And even though they don't offer smoothies, they have mochi!!!\n\nOf course I went straight for the red velvet, but I added a few globs of dulce de leche and peanut butter, and tons of mochi.\n\nI'm sorry Mojo, but Zoyo is my new yogurt lover.","Hands down my favorite ice cream place in all of Pittsburgh. All homemade ice cream with unique flavors like peach cheesecake, blueberry cobbler, Vietnamese coffee, lavender and more! All of the ingredients are labeled so if you have any food allergies that is incredibly helpful. When you walk in you will instantly be surrounded with the smell of freshly baked waffle cones and your excitement for the sweet treat will grow!!","I had great ice cream here.  They have unusual flavors which makes life interesting. Wish my waistline could stand me stopping in more often!","Amazing ice cream place In town. Friendly environment and knowledgeable staff. Customize according to your taste and desire.","Unique and delicious!! Highly recomend all the desserts and treats. Very affordable. Very friendly and helpful.","Birthday Cake cone was delicious. It's a very small intimate ice cream parlor. It tasted pretty good if ever in the area again I would stop by and get another cone","This ice cream was awesome!   Having the liquid nitrogen flash freeze the cream makes the ice cream creamier to me.  Plus my kids loved watching the liquid nitrogen as they made the ice cream","Plain Delicious. Freshest ingredient ice cream I've ever had. Obscure but fabulous flavors.","Amazing food!  Didn't know what to expect but could not be happier with our selection.  Also the people are incredibly friendly and make sure that everything is perfect.  I would highly recommend!","Carmel Latte with endless foam.... Literally!! Every girls dream. I loved the mis-matched kitty cat mugs and beautiful local art against exposed brick! This place is totally doing it.","This place was great! So many options to top your yogurt with! And so many different yogurt flavors! There are cool couches to hang out at or tables! Good stuff!","Best donuts I've ever had !!!! Super friendly staff too !! We've been waiting for them to open and finally went this morning, so worth the wait.","I had Royal Milk Tea not bad with boba no jelly. It was a little expensive $5.00+ for a small about the size of a grande at Starbucks. Didn't try anything else.","I love this place. The owner is such a nice man, and the rest of the staff are lovely as well. Great patio and great coffee!","Found this amazing place on Yelp (of course) and had to try it!! We live about 20 minutes away but after reading all the good reviews I figured it would be worth the trip. I was definitely right!! The ice cream was amazing!! The owner Brandon and all of the staff were super sweet and very friendly! I would seriously recommend this place to anyone in need of a sweet treat! I'll be back for sure!","I had the Canadian Made and WOW is it delicious. And I'm only recently vegan so I know what good ice cream is supposed to taste like!","This place is awesome. The taro root boba is great! I also really like the taro root snow with condensed milk.","The gelato was fantastic and you can try as many flavors as needed. The customer service was amazing. Great employees","I wore my pj bottoms and got 50% off my piled high order. I took my selections home to enjoy and to share with my dogs. They loved the pistachio and cake batter but one of them is fro-yo intolerant and doggie diarrhea is never a pleasant experience.","Amazing crepes and service! Family owned and operated is always a good indication. I had a strawberry Nutella crepe and I loved it! Can't wait to try their other varieties!","Staff was very friendly, the service was fast, they gave free samples, and the Gelato tasted great. We got milk tea and Vietnamese coffee. We weren't really ready to try the more exotic ones","Enjoyed the ice cream and sitting outdoors eating it in 65 degree weather with my family. Not too chilly for people from Hawaii. Everyone loved their selections and the one scoop servings were very generous.","Love the Ice Cream here. It's a cute little spot and there is places to sit outside. Just down the street from where I live.","Fantastic burger and you have to try their concrete mixer, their version of a milk shake. It is so think you have to dig it out of the cup with a spoon, with your choice of mixes it is out of this world. You order at the counter but they bring the food to your table, not bad for a fast food burger joint.","Even if you just go to try out some crazy blue ice cream, go. Awesome owners answer any and all questions you have, you get to try out every flavor beforehand, you just can't go wrong. Cute building with lots of character, super awesome and delicious creamy goodness of ice cream, great people. You just can't lose.","Wow! Incredible quality for a little ice cream stand. Typical cones, sundaes, and milkshakes. But a menu of burgers, fries, nachos, etc. and items like the raspberry toasted almond tort sundae really set this place a part from competitors. Worth the trip.","I live a mike away from one of the few family owned fairies in PA, so I know my ice cream!  I was walking back to my hotel with my husband and we stepped inside Millie's. We ordered cones which were still warm when they handed them to us!  I usually go chocolate, but I was curious about the cherry cobbler flavored ice cream. Holy Cow! ( pun intended). I'm a believer!","The best best cookie I've had. I had the burnt toffee ice cream which was great! Would love to go here again soon!","This place is pretty awesome. Occasionally I find they're out of certain flavors but it's still worth 5 stars in my book.","Awesome coffee shop near the movie theatre! Nice selection, clean, and quiet. Americano Hot was great! Gonna make this my regular spot on the way to seem my weekly flicks at the nearby Harkins.","My go-to yogurt place! The ladies behind the counter are always so sweet and helpful. Thank you for making every visit worth it and making me want to come back for more! Amazing customer service and great yogurt choices and toppings. (+ it's always kept clean!)","Loved it! Had the chocolate soft serve rolled in peanuts and drizzled in peanut butter sauce, yummy! It's soft serve so don't expect normal ice cream. I want to try the Cotton candy one next time, will definitely return again.","If you're looking for this then the food may be to your liking, but unfortunately I was not looking for this type of food thus I did not enjoy it. Even still I'm not going to give this restaurant a bad review simply due to my own ignorance I'd still recommend this restaurant.","Flavors galore with every succulent mouthful! A spendy treat but well worth it: employees were gracious and welcoming to boot!","I love the Taro Boba milk tea. The bobas made just right. Usually its a hit or miss.  You either get them way too mushy or tough. They have beautiful art hanging on the walls and its a cool spot to talk/chill with friends. The joint has board games you can play with while you socialize","My favorite stop for Gelato and Sorbet. This visit got the Strawberry and Champagne Sorbet and Pina Colada Gelato. Great combo. Service is always great at this location and the selection of flavors is fantastic. \n\nI remember they used to have a flavor similar to sour cherry, but I don't know what happened to it - I miss it so much. \n\nI wish there were more Frost Gelato locations, there's not even one in Scottsdale!!","Oh yeah!! Here's a nice place to go to discover unusual but really good ice creams! I'm speaking of natural and homemade gelato which are changing everyday like fresh mint, guava (yum yum), blueberry & basil or fererro rocher. This hidden & tiny place is definitely worth a shot!","I ordered the fat Mac and the reunion tour by the slice and a vegan poutine. I can't believe this is vegan. It was amazing. Be prepared for a line up. Also, the place is pretty small and there is no AC. But shoutout to the kitchen staff for still working in that heat.","Love this spot, the BLT and potato salad are to die for! Shakes, malts italian sodas are amazing too. Seems like there is a lot of staff turnover (or maybe they just have a lot of staff), they are usually good but some of them are lacking in customer service skills. The owners are great though, always on site and friendly :)","The DIVIDER is brilliant! Helping indecisive people like myself live an easier life! Can't make decisions? NO PROBLEM! \n\nZoyo has good flavors in rotation, a nice environment to enjoy your froyo, and an awesome toppings bar.","I got a love it Cookie Minster, it's mint ice cream with oreos and fudge. It was awesome! I got it because i don't like chocolate chips in ice cream. Initially the guy who made it added chocolate chips and then when we started looking confused he asked his coworker and then took them out. He gave an awesome amount of ice cream-we ended up sharing the love it size which i would recommend. Even in the dead of winter ice cream is always a good treat!","I love ice cream!!! I was super excited to try this ice cream shop from Tucson.... The ice cream is really good and I love the creative flavors. They have a sundae with brownie or cookie or butter cake on the bottom... pretty delish. I wouldn't say this is the best ice cream in town, but it is very good and definitely better than some of the chain places. If you're in Scottsdale, definitely check out the screamery!!!","This place is absolutely incredible. I've taken multiple friends/family here and they all can't wait to return. The service is always great and I love the selection of gelato available. Recommendation - don't leave without getting the blueberry muffin gelato. It might be the best this ice ever tasted!","What a pleasure it was to walk into Brett's on a hot day yesterday and order a \"carrot cake\" ice cream cone.  The store was cool and inviting, the staff SO friendly and the ice cream was heavenly.","What a fun, hidden gem in the Phoenix area. They have a huge selection of soda fountain floats (99 to be exact, I think). Everything from cotton candy soda to amaretto flavor. The ice cream sundaes also were terrific. \nThe food is something to be desired though. That's why go only for the ice cream :)","the milkshakes are super cute and they also taste very good! they give you the extra of the milkshake in another cup so that's cool too :) a super cute spot and nice place to take pictures !","First ever icecream sandwich....\nIt was summer the place was new I think we waited over an hour\nI'll go back","Tried this today (not the store but at a food truck festival) they are delicious! Not too messy to eat.  The ice cream was nice and creamy. Will definitely have this the next time I see them at a festival.","I tried its stout ice cream, which is amazing. It's my first time trying beer flavor ice cream. This place also has green tea, coffee, chocolate flavors. The cashier is friendly. I'm glad that there is a Greg's ice cream near my apartment.","I gave the Rita's on Bell Road a bad Yelp a couple weeks ago. Now I'm coming here to my regular location and everything's fantastic just like I'm used to. This isn't just because I have the Yelp guilt about giving a bad Yelp. It's really good here!","Best\nIcecream\nEver!\n\nI live in Ahwatukee and we seriously drive out of the way when we want dessert to go here. I only wish there was a closer location. I have never had a bad flavor, the prices are fair, great helpful staff, and would recommend sweet Republic to anyone who wants amazing ice cream.","Such a cute restaurant. I can't speak for the food, but the Yin and Yang Sundae I had was SO GOOD. And there was so much of it!! I can't wait to come back with more of an appetite to try the food! The antique/vintage store they have is cute as well! The staff is very friendly. Definitely a must see if you're in Phoenix.","One of the best liege waffles I've had in a while. Ask for them fresh and you will receive a melty centered pretzels dripping with sweetness combined with the perfect toppings. \n\nI enjoyed the Nutella waffle so much that I purchased a single waffle all by itself because it was that good!\n\nThis place is small only seats about 10 people max so I'd grab your dessert to go or travel light.","Took my kids on a road trip to Pittsburgh and decided to get some ice cream. Ended up at Klavon's and not only did we enjoy their banana split and coke float, but their service was excellent! They have a variety of ice cream, splits and floats to choose from and other stuff. We'll definitely go there again if we're ever in Pittsburgh!","Went here for a birthday treat! There were so many flavors to choose from, including lots of dairy free options too! Delicious ice cream just a few feet from market square! Perfect!","We brought a couple of the butterscotch tarts home to my mom - who gave them the absolute greatest compliment by saying they brought her back to my grandmother's caramel tarts. She started by cutting one in half - then ate the other half and the last one in the plate too. My grandmother was a renowned baker particularly well-known for her pies - so this was quite a compliment and such a nice memory for my mom and I. Keep it up!","I LOVE Millie's! The ice cream is fantastic, the aesthetic is so pleasing, and it's so clean and cute. Whenever we eat at noodlehead this is always our dessert stop! Viatnemese Coffee & Dolce De Leche are my favorites!","This place is a gem in the Beaches! Loved it! I had the cherry gelato in a cone....so good! I want to try the blood orange next time as it had caught my eye as well. Perfect ice cream place on a perfect summer day","My boyfriend and I are on vacation in Arizona and we found them on yelp. We enjoyed our shave ice, very authentic hawaiian shave ice and a variety of flavors. The owner is very personable. We would highly recommend to try them out.","Yummy, goodies straight from heaven. Plus lots of cool unusual finds. Love the old fashion feel of the ice cream shop. Great customer service and pies!","My good friend showed me this place and I love coming here when I need a pick me up drink. I always get their strawberry green bull. It's amazing and so is the service! The place has good vibes all around.","Low key spot in away from downtown. Super small... Super small place. Not a lot of options buts that no problem the gelato was great. I got the ferrero roch and cookies and cream gelato. AMAZING. They played hip hop music in a big juke box that was loud which I thought was great BUT when children came by they should've turned it off because of the explicit lyrics. Just FYI lol","For a girl who has a sweet tooth this place hits the spot. I love their desert concept. Not to mention that the vanilla ice cream dipped in oreo cookie with cookie dough tasted amazing. You might want to grab a cup and spoon though because it might get kind of messy.. the good kind of messy! It's always packed though so be prepared to wait a bit.","The watermelon slush and strawberry mojito sparkler are both super good and refreshing! The watermelon slush tastes just like Tastea, which is a boba shop in California popular for their own watermelon slush. They add tons of watermelon bits to their drink here, which I love. I can't wait to come back and try their ice cream and more yummy drinks!","My favorite boba/tea/coffee shop in Phoenix! Everything they offer is soooo delicious, they are super quick and the interior of the shop is super cute. I usually get the Thai Tea with boba and it is the best. Love this place and highly recommend!","A fun little diner, we went here as a family for dinner one night. I had the meatloaf which was excellent! It was soft and moist and had great flavor. I also indulged in a I Dream Of Jeannie milkshake which was fantastic. My kids had a great time and enjoyed their food as well. There is a lot of neat history on display that is worth checking out before leaving. Service was on point and the diner was clean.","Delicious ice cream with a ridiculous number of dips and toppings. If you start with a great ice cream, it's only going to get better. Very good stuff.","Boston's Mass General Hospital cafeteria and this one are the two best hospital cafs in the world. \n\nGreat, made to order food, at reasonable prices. \n\nLunch specials every day make it even better.","I liked the ice-cream. I got the pistachio almond 1 scoop in waffles for about $7. It was definitely better than the frozen yogurt place down the street but it wasn't special.\nStaff were friendly though","Great little spot! Awesome staff and amazing flavors!! We visit from spring to fall and try the new flavors! Never regret it!!!","Great ice cream, amazingly rich chocolate gelato!","SO GOOOOOOD. Low-Calorie Chocolate + Toasted Marshmallow = Literally Heaven. I've been here on vacation for the week and this is the perfect place for a little something sweet.","Love their drinks. They have drink combos to order or you can make your own which I like. Their açaí bowl is also delicious!  The staff never are super helpful. They know what goes well with what and they don't rush you to order. The only think I don't enjoy is the price. It is a little pricey compared to similar places. But the atmosphere here is clean and fun.","The Roasted Marshmallow, is Devine. So many unique flavors it's hard to choose. Coffee Toffee is incredible even the Chocolate Ice Cream is great. Don't think you could go wrong with this Fresh Ice Cream.","Michael was our mixologist and guided us to make the perfect yogurt. He was welcoming from the moment we walked through the door. Was knowledgeable about what yogurt was dairy free and low on sugar. Great experience, we will be back. Thanks Michael.","Currently eating some of the creamiest ice cream I've ever had. It's my first visit, but I'll definitely be back again. Not only is the ice cream excellent, the service is top notch. We were warmly greeted upon entry and offered many samples before ordering. The owner, David, is extremely kind/friendly. Everything is made from scratch and delicious beyond words. I highly recommend Peace Cream. Two thumbs up! :)","This place has a good selection of gelato and sorbet and they will even make smoothies out of them if you want.  Customer service could be a bit friendlier but all and all I love it cause the deserts.","Just heard about this place last weekend. It is my new favorite addiction! The Only 8 yogurt has only 8 calories per ounce and the flavors I've tasted are yummy. My favorite two, so far, are Oatmeal Cookie and Cookie Batter. I'm working out and losing weight and this place takes care of my sweet tooth without putting me over on my calories. Give it a try!","This was my first time here and let me tell ya... it was awesome!!! I wanted the mangoneada because with this crazy heat it sounded good, but they didn't have it. I  ended up going with a pb & j and it was great. I felt like I was eating a cold peanut butter sandwich.  I have to say I really enjoyed my ice cream.","Quality gelato: cost is worth it, flavors, location, presentation, vegan flavors. Only problem to me is the customer service is NOT consistantly the most cheery, should be for $3 a scoop. Plus they used to have there own shop spot, now unfortunately you have to wait in long LGO line.","Best ice cream in Phoenix with unique and constantly changing flavors...and two of the sweetest people that own the shop! I feel like family every time I go in. They have only been open for a little over 3 months and I have been here about 5 times! I love bringing out of town visitors here and my boyfriend asks every single week if we can take a walk over to Novel. Highly recommend!","They're staff is super friendly and the milk teas are really good! The trandiitonal boba are also pretty well cooked!","My sis and I came for a snack and each ordered a O.G. mini, which I believe was plenty. We both liked that the cinnamon cone was super fresh, quite warm when we got it. The ice cream tastes like normal self-serve, nothing special. I was worried about the ice cream melting to the bottom of the paper but to my surprise, I found a chocolate ball at the bottom! Quite a sweet way to complete a cone! Plus side, they offer vegan option too!!","I just love this frozen yogurt place. They have amazing flavors and amazing toppings. I am pet much a regular customer now, make a visit atleast once a week if not twice. \nThe best its their red velvet flavored frozen yogurt which is just so super delicious.\nLove it love it love it!!","Ummmmm my new favorite ice cream place. I love that they have mini cones starting at $1.\n\nI was a little sad that they had no matcha dip flavor so I got the coffee bit chocolate flavor which was the bomb.\n\nThey even have pastry cones. Some of the toppings they had were questionable like green peas and tortilla chips but I like that they are out of the box with it.\n\nGreat place to beat the heat or have a little treat......literally","I got ice cream from here over a year ago and have been meaning to review. I got a scoop of honey vanilla and I still crave it til this day. They give a very generous portion and it comes with a waffle cone as well, so it's such a steal! Located so close to the beach, it's a great place to go after a full day of being out in the sun. I can't wait to come back another day.","I work for a large law firm downtown, and we absolutely loved having Yogurt Time cater at one of our recent \"Yogurt Socials\" here at the office.  The owner was super quick at getting back to me with my catering order and very easy to work with.  Everyone raved about how tasty the flavors were.  Great options for dairy-free eaters as well!  Thank you, Yogurt Time!","There bubble waffle cone was actually really good, but there wasn't enough ice cream in it. The boba was decent. I personally think it's kinda gross that they just leave their bobas and toppings uncovered, but I understand that it's for displayed purposes. The cashier was very nice and helpful. I enjoy the experience and would most definitely come here again.","When you google doughnut and ice cream this is place pops ups. It is so good the fresh in house ice cream is beyond tasty. The people are so friendly and genuine! I had Sicilian pistachio ice cream topped with Cinnamon Toast Crunch all in a warm doughnut","Amazing. Even better than Matsamotos on the North Shore of OAhu. Lots of flavor and great scoop of ice cream in the middle, Hawai'ian staple mango, banana and Tiger's Blood.","This is a lot more better at this time. They have a good customer service with the fast service as well. Their quality also improve now. It's taste delicious and different than other drink place. I will come back again with my friends ^^ The chamoyada and chocoSol are the best","Great experience and fair prices considering the size of the cones. You can try flavors too and the the sample spoon size is large which is a nice touch. I love the cotton candy and fruit toppings on the cones. A definite repeat whenever in Toronto on a summer night.","Very cute store! Perfect to bring yourself and a nice book or date, bestfriend or family! Probably one of the best places to get dessert here in Toronto. They have wide variety of ice cream, crepes, waffles, hot drinks etc. It gets busy late in the evening when people come in after dinner! \n\nThanks for reading!","A delightful find on Jane Street.  A true chocolatier.  Reasonable prices, organic and true quality.  A lovely sitting area at the front by the window and the hot chocolate is made to order.  I must go back to try their ice cream and sorbet.","AMAZING. Amazing ice cream, amazing waffles and donuts, amazing treats. A wonderful concept and a creative take on a classic dessert. We love love love Novel. The owners are friendly, genuine people. The atmosphere is great and the choices are wonderful. The ice cream is handmade and truly tastes authentic. I would (and do) recommend Novel to all my friends!","It was good. Not earth shattering, but good. There was a long line, so I may have gotten a little more hyped for it than I should have.\n\nWill probably return.","If you like homemade delicious ice cream, this is the place for you.  My favorite is the birthday cake ice cream in a waffle cone.  Their mint chocolate chip is very good as well.  I used to work across the street from here and would stop by all the time.","Definitely satisfies your sweet tooth! Over the top desserts. Service was good as well. What's not to like?","Man o man these burgers are pretty bomb they r melt in your mouth delicious the bacon cheddar burger .... the cheddar gives it that special lil kick just gotta try it to knw wat I'm talkin about","Very unique flavors! \n\nOntario pear and pumpkin seed soft serve twist - $5\nPumpkin seed reminds me of pistachio and you can really taste the pear texture for the Ontario pear.\n\nPistachio gelato bar - $5\nPistachio gelato covered with white chocolate. \n\nHazelnut gelato bar - $5\nLoved how it doesn't taste like Nutella. Just the right balance of hazelnut flavor\n\nThere's Green P Parking right beside the store","Just found this little place right by my house. I think it was the best cupcake I've ever had in my life. It was so moist and just the right amount of sweetness!!! We will definitely be back !!","This could possibly be the best little pastry shop in the city. Hidden off the beaten track of busy Bloor W./ Bloorcourt gives it even more allure. Located right next to Ossington Station- Delaware entrance. Butter tarts are perfect, cupcakes are almost too pretty to eat and the Ice cream sandwiches are  usually lined up for, especially on weekends. I believe its  handmade ice cream  too! A must try for any sweets lover. Place looks like it should be featured in a magazine. Always friendly.","So thankful for this shop and its sorbet!!! Very clean good service and better gelato.","YUMMMM this place is delish. And, the pizza takes no time at all to make. The gelato is great too and if you have the loyaltree app you can get free stuff. We had a plain pizza (boring but good) and a Med.?? (can't remember but there were artichokes). Both were great and there is WAYYY too much for one person, you can def. share these.\n\nI really want to try a gelato milkshake! Looks delish.","Their jalapeno poppers are actually spicy!! Can't wait to try more stuff, service was great, beer was amazing, what more do you need?","Fun little spot in Downtown Phoenix. Great ice cream with some interesting flavors.","Wonderful gelato, great drink menu (didn't try but decent prices and thoughtful drinks - ie: no appletini), cute decor and friendly staff.","Best chocolate! I buy it all over the place. I have even dabbled in making it. This is the best.","Always cheery staff willing to give you samples to make sure you'll enjoy your choice. Dangerous to have nearby.","DiPietro's is a North Hills staple if you're dining in or getting a pizza to go. \n\nThe dining room is casual but offers great Italian dishes. The to-go options are great, too. Their pizza is definitely some of the best around, and the white pizza is one of the best items on the menu.","Love this place! First time in Pittsburgh back in December 2017, was there for less than three days and went here twice. I got the Chocolatier sundae each time, delicious (the chocolate caramel that it's topped with is great) and my travel companion got the Fried Ice Cream milkshake and was obsessed with it. It's a little on the pricey side and the lines can get long but it's worth it! I would probably go back to Pittsburgh just to come here again.","Cute place, good service, delicious smoothies & donuts. Got the Mango boba smoothie and strawberry cream donut","The best coffee ice cream and waffle cone i've ever had! The inside of the shop is so cute and they have water for dogs! My new fave ice cream shop","Don't like when people are cheap with my food - how much does making kefir cost you really? Fill in half of the cup!","over-priced place.no waffle cones. Soft, almost melting ice cream. I don't think I will return and pay $5 for a scoop of ice cream. There is also a sign saying you have to pay $1 if you take a sample but do not purchase. \nI know it's yourkville, but the quality is just not worth the price.","This is the worst run Nekter ever the wait is always so long and there is no place to wait for your order.  The manager is so rude I had a complaint about my order and she said there was nothing she could do about it and then turned around and yelled at the young man making the drinks. There is no reason to go to this location ever!","This place is very unaccommodating and rude! I would tread very cautiously working with them.  There are other bakeries with better reviews, 4.9/5 and 5/5, and there is a reason for that. These guys just don't know how to treat people, and I was dealing with the owner. Pretty terrible.","Went to this location once. The incompetent morons charged me twice, on two different days, for one visit. Called to talk to a manager, told he wasn't even there. Clearly, the incompetence starts at the top and goes down at this place.","no no no no no. soggy and too thick of a sauce... Onion too thick so raw when the pie comes out... pepperoni buried under the cheese so it doesn't get crisp... no credit cards taken... nowhere to park... just no from every angle.","These guys are so cheap they wanted to charge me to put cinnamon on my dessert. Trash all over the parking lot and store front. Wake up corporate!!!","The texture of the black sesame cake was very grainy and not smooth. The cake tasted wet, grainy and old. \n\nThe green tea crepe cake was ok not as good as the other store. Prefer their other store better for crepe cake because they seem more fresh","Essentially an overpriced Dairy Queen Blizzard. Sure there's points for presentation but it's all empty show. I'd even put the soft serve a rung below the old DQ and at 7$+ I can definitely skip it.","My chicken sandwich was cold and there was barely any chicken, it was mostly all bread. You can also tell it was sitting out for awhile, the meat was hard to bite into. I definitely won't be coming back to this location!","Just a stand in the corner of jobot. Not one flavor tastes good enough to warrant the $4.50/scoop price and very icy and not creamy at all.","I gave this place a 2nd chance for breakfast. Apparently, when you ask for not tomatoes you get them anyways. :-/ I'm never going back there again","When you compare Fair Trade to Conspire and Lux ... ummm ... well ... there is no comparison ... Fair Trade's decor is BLAND and last time I went there the Barista was less than personable.\n\nAlso they lack the electrical outlets at every table which at this late state in the game is a fail for any coffeehouse.","Not the best ice cream around service is friendly but for the price I would expect better quality ice cream.","Too much hype and too much money for average ice cream with a fancy coating.","Overhyped. The ice cream here is expensive, not that great (too heavy), and the lines are ridiculously long. I'd recommend the place to people who like wacky-looking ice cream that tastes....meh.","Went to Culver's about 10 min ago. Our 6 year old daughter ordered a corn dog. They took forever to bring out the food. We get home and find an over cooked corn dog that can hardly be described as edible. You be the judge","i came to snow time ordered regular size take out Injeomi bingsoo on last week in the evening. I saw 3 to 4 customers who ordered first and then I asked the counter girl how long take the time do I need waiting for. She said around 20 minutes this was fine. But the actual time waiting around almost 40 minutes. Basically, the time making this dessert around 10 to 13 minutes for each.  Even though, taste is not bad. The time making very slow this is fail.","Not the burgers I remember from DQ.... What happened to the flame broiled? Service is weak... Nice but slow, slow, slow...","they use too much cheese, not enough sauce, and the bottom crust is too thin.  pizza amir on forward is better.","This sonic is the absolute worst. I have been here a few times and every time something was missing. Today I was missing two things and my food was burnt. The girl who took the order was amazing and read our order back and was great but whoever was in charge of checking the order was obviously not qualified - missing and burnt food. Good work.","The first thing I noticed when walking in was the god awful smell. I ordered corn in a cup and a Mexican coke. The coke was WAY over priced at $2.50. I figured the corn in a cup would be pretty decent. At $3 for a tiny cup, it is also way over priced. The corn literally has no flavor. It's pretty repulsive. NOTHING like real elote en vaso. Seriously disgusting. I DO NOT recommend anyone to go here for any \"Mexican\" treats.","Their food is good. I came here for a flame flower burger and we sat in the drive thru for TWENTY MINUTES with 6 other cars. What a joke! Do your work and stop leaving people waiting for so damn long.","This place is so cute and such a chill place to go by the waterfront. It's unfortunate though that the store isn't very efficient and the staff is not very attentive. The lines were going in two different directions and it was unnecessarily chaotic. When we finally got to the front of the line, the person at cash register wasn't listening to what I wanted and served me watered down coffee. I had the other barista change it for me and even she was shocked I was served my drink.","Holy cow the prices.. almost $20 with tax for those fruit cups with the smoothie. It's good for the first couple of bites until everything gets mushed together. Happy I got to try it but won't bother coming back,l.","Love it but staff needs help. here 1 month ago with a friend and some girl was training and learning...fine. Came back tonight and the same girl is there and still doesn't know what the hell is going on. Poor girl at register was working so hard and had no help","This Dairy Queen is a funny place. The place is clean, but their service is not friendly. Banana split we ordered is not prepared right. Like someone here says, at least I could get Ice cream and this is the best thing in this Dairy Queen.","This is run of the mill ice cream. Tastes like something I could buy at the super market. Nothing to write home about. Next!!!","Went to Chatime to get some bbt and noticed this store. It was the grand opening so I decided to give it a try. I was the very last customer for the day. The store and desserts look good for Instagram but it did not taste good. The dough was mushy and the red bean was disgusting. I ate half of it then threw it away. Save your $8 for better dessert.","This is the slowest service EVER! Not impressed one bit. We have been in line for 20 min and we were the 3rd car.","Painful to watch the staff......so grumpy it hurts to watch. And we ordered a kids specialty ice cream... finally got it and they don't have whipped cream so we paid extra for an ice cream they can't even make. And there is a grocery store right next door. Would be nice to know before you order and wait 10-15 min that what you ordered can't even be made.. bummer 1st and last trip.","Terrible mini donuts. Look tastier than what they actually are.\nThey aren't filled. The just put the filling in the middle of the donut.\nWe tried the Nutella, the Oreo and pistachio. But sorry, not coming back!","New review \n\nWhere's the cheese?  Guess they no longer put any cheese on their pizza.  Took people here from out of town and all of our slices looked like this!  Embarrassing!!","Service was terrible, rude employees. Kenya was rushing to take the order and acting frustrated like she understood we wanted tater tots and all we received were fries. I would normally never take the time to write a review like this for a fast food restaurant but this was terrible. Zero stars","Super regular ice cream on top of junk cookies or waffles\nToo much line up\nDon't recommend","First time. Boba slush was super icy! Was chewing chunks of ice! And watered down taro flavor. Disappointed because I love boba :(","Found my self waiting for a long time for the restroom that was completely empty.  No sign to suggest that you need a key. Please stop waisting\n customers time.","Not at all impressed. Limited menu items and the staff liked saying, \"no we aren't like the other stores\". I say liked because they basically told us to go somewhere else and so we did.","I would've given a much higher rating, but this place doesn't accept cash which is absolutely absurd. I would have loved to come back here, but unfortunately am unable to because I pay for things in cash. I'm not sure why a business would refuse to accept the most liquid form of payment. I also can't imagine how much business they're losing due to this. It's very unfortunate.","How do you mess up a Reese's blast? Well.. Just put ice cream in a cup.. But only half way up the cup.. Spit of whipped cream and dump candy on top...\n\nOh and wait 7mins at the drive thru for it. When there is only two other customers there... Really? COME ON SONIC!!\n\nIf this location wasn't so close to home I wouldn't have dealt with this for so long.. No more from this sonic :(","While the ice cream is absolutely delicious, there is no ADA entrance. There are several stairs to get in the front entrance and no alternate entrance. So, if you're a wheelchair user like me, you're out of luck unless someone can go in and get ice cream for you.","Although it's def not the best icecream in the city, I sometimes get it and enjoy it. However... today they served me what looks exactly like a lump of ... .  Do they not get trained to put the icecream into the cup properly??","It is just a hype.  Nothing special about this place except for some instagrammable icecream.\n\nBlack charcoal doesn't have taste. It just look black. And it doesn't really have much health benefits either. \n\nI will not come back, may recommend to those who want instagrammable icecream.","Great ice cream!  The girls are working hard but they need some help big time!  25+ minutes inside the store in line and still 3 people ahead of me.  I guess the manager doesn't realize that people like ice cream when it starts getting warm out.   They need at least 3 workers and that would still be challenging.  Great ice cream if you don't mind slow service.","Dirty, bad coffee, terrible services.. The worst caffes in downtown!!! Owner is maybe still on the Vacation","Meh. It's literally soft serve, like out of an ice cream truck. But I guess being trendy justifies the $7? The line is always long, but moves relatively quickly. I'd plan to wait about a half hour. I had the mint one and my date had fluffed nutter. Both good, but nothing special. If you like to be trendy and snap that pic for Instagram, try it once, just to say you did ;)","Gelato is great, but people going to this shop bring their anlmals constantly, they are not service animals and they go by the counter & they sit in chairs outside Gross","Lackluster experience. Extremely long wait for basic Wendy's milkshake you can top with dollar store items. Our wait was well over ten minutes, one lady making one shake at a time at ten deep. Then, they couldn't make mine because the ice cream was too had. Ridiculous, non-existent time management savvy. Don't recommend. Won't be back.","Why do the people working here always seem like they're mad at you? They always have a frown and never say thank you. It is also plainly obvious that they do not wash their hands between handling the cash and making your drinks....","Got the Thai Me Up around $8, everything in store in generally around that price range, for the amount of food I definitely think it's a little pricy. The specific one I got was very oily and sweet, and my friend who got a different one also agrees on the oiliness. \nWatching the people make your ice cream was fun though, so recommended if you have never tried before and want to experience a little, but not a place I would want to go back!","Slow, hot inside, forgetting orders. How many people do you need to make a simple order?","If you're hoping to get service at the Cold Stone counter - forget it. I've been to this location twice and I've left empty handed. Employees don't bother acknowledging you. They stare at you as you wait for service. \nThe ice cream is just as pitiful as the service. Doesn't look like they restock anything depleted. \nPathetic location and no regard for the customer. Tim Hortons should be ashamed.","The worst ice cream I have ever had in my life. I found this place in yelp because of the rate is relatively high. I ordered one chocolate and one vanilla ice cream, omg, after tasting them, I was thinking what is wrong with people who give the store high rate? Serious! And how can the store still be surviving? A very undelighting experience!","Late Sunday evening on Easter Sunday.  Cashier named Danny did not greet us but instead seemed preoccupied with a phone order. She ended her phone call and did not say \"welcome and how may I help you?  What about another team member to handle new customers? This was my first visit. \nGood food for a high price.  Not sure I'll return due to poor customer experience.","Staff was nice but the Oreo that was on top of my ice cream was stale and I didn't like how it was only one scoop of ice cream on a bed of shaved ice milk. For the price I paid it was not worth it and I won't be going back.","I can't believe I was refused a glass of water here! And on a day where the temperature was 111°, no less. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Arizona has a law forbidding this. The guy behind the counter had the nerve to tell me they don't have water there. Really? I guess I'll be taking my yogurt craving business elsewhere. It didn't wow me, anyway.","Really had enjoyed coming here for breakfast a few years ago.  Came back last week to have breakfast, but no luck this time.  Service without a smile, lukewarm cappuccino and mediocre food.  Sorry to say, but not coming back.","The taste of the gelato was alright, nothing spectacular. But what turned me off more so was I found a fly in the middle of my gelato. If you go, try the mascarpone, it was the best of the flavors I got.","It was so disappointing here, looking at the place you would think it is a high end chocolate shop but it could not of been further. The chocolates where bland and tasteless but with a not so nice price tag. \n\nThe girl who served me was more interested in gossiping with a friend than being polite to her customers, sadly I will not be returning.","Pretty disappointed. The servers totally missed asking my order and went to the person after me. When I gave my order to the cashier, he definitely had a major attitude when I asked for a cookie. He used his bare hands to grab it into a bag. VERY disgusting. Overall, very disappointed.","The location and the stores are good, is just like snow time it have a little things in the menu and the location is right beside coco, so I will chose coco than this ice cream. However I will change my mind when the summer is coming, so far is winter and I feel really disappointing about the ice cream so bad review for now","Crews are not approachable.. the lady who seems to be the owner is rude. She wasnt so nice the way she talk to the customers. They need a better customer service.","Fried sides such as the cheese sticks and poppers are ok.  Pizza crust is pretty bland. Food overall was a let down.  Downstairs was very hot and almost unbearable to order. I wouldn't go back and overall just a blah experience.","Does anyone try in this state anymore? They couldn't even get the ice cream right and thats what you do. The burger was awful and wrong. They even took the whole order back and still messed it up. Not a single manager to be found.","Bad service , latte was too watery .. really slow service\nWe came first time .. waited 15 min for my drinks .. my husbands came out after 20 .\nLooks like the workers were just standing and talking while we r waiting \nIt was the worst latte I ever had","After 2 years decided to celebrate with a quart of pre packed Founder's choice.ice cream  even though it was almost 3,$ more,full of bits of cake and NO NUTS !!!!   see how they cheapen things like u wont notice,disappointed!!!!!","Been coming here for years its under new ownership has gone down significantly. So many health code violations same hot plate I bought from walmart user to cook meat and your bread on the same element! Yuck!! Pass!","Service sucks. Line wasn't even that long and it took half an hour to order. The employees don't know what's happening. It's extremely small and tight in the store so ur constantly bumping into people. Ice cream was good though","This sonic needs to get it together. 75% of the stalls have been out of order for 3 weeks. Plus every time we come we wait 5 minutes after pressing the button to even get someone to place an order.","I tried red velvet, passion fruit, raspberry, cookies and cream and ferrero rocher. The cupcakes were so so. I just didn't enjoy them. The raspberry cupcake with cream cheese icing was the best out of the lot I tried. As for the service, I shall quote another reviewer here, Sarah W who puts it perfectly- \"friendly but disinterested\".","I think they just ran out of tapioca or tea cause it took a while for my order to be made. I ordered the roasted oolong milk tea with tapioca, no sugar, less ice. The tapioca is good but there is way too much milk to tea ratio. There is less ice though which is nice. In the picture I already took two sips but it was fill to the top. I would try other places near by instead of coming back here.","Got three shaved icecream for $40. Came in small container, sorry but the price is outrageous for the amount that they give. It took over 45 min to make our icecream. It was an empty place when we got there. First and last try, will not be returning. Quite disappointing.","Just had the worst experience at Sonic I've ever had. We went to go buy a couple Burgers because they were half off after 5 on Tuesdays.  They ended up getting our Burgers wrong and only took $2 off instead  of given Burgers half off.  Their drive-thru intercom sucks so bad we could hardly even understand each other.  \nDon't waste your time with these clowns they don't have their s*** together!","I've been craving a good fish sandwich for quite some time, so I thought I'd give Culver's a try. The fish was nice and crunchy, but totally without flavor. For the prices they charge, I would expect something more, like salt. I'll have to find someplace else to go for a fish sandwich, because I won't be going back to Culvers.","Weak coffee, breakfast sandwich lackluster.  No friendly greeting when I entered nor a thank you when I left.  Overall not a pleasant experience.  Much better coffee options in the area.","Went today and ordered the green matcha milk with boba in one of those cool glass reusable bottles with the Milk Run label on it.  Except...they apparently ran out of the ones that say Milk Run on it (or do they just incidentally give you one without it?) Will they honor the 10% if I go back as it isn't the same as the others?  This perplexing quandry overshadowed my visit as I feel a little, how do you say....ripped off!","Bad service! We came and set at the bar for about 15 min and no one even mentioned that we needed to order at the register not to mention there was no one at the register the entire time. Until someone came in and stand by the register then one of the employees asked what that person want. Then after we ordered an ice cream to go. They made it and then it took them another 10 minutes to just handle it to us! Everyone is ignorant and very slow!","I just visited this location on my lunch break and I will never go back! My husband had to repeat our order to the woman taking our order (Veronica) three times and when we received our order it still wasn't correct. I actually felt bad for the carhop because he got stuck in the middle of it and had to apologize for Veronica's mistake. The food made the experience even worse because the eggs in my burrito were actually stale. Avoid this location if you can!","Well it looked good from a distance. When I had the yogurt in my cup and went for toppings....tons of bugs come flying out. I said to the boy working - well I guess I'll pass on the toppings with all those bugs, which we both clearly saw....to which he didn't seem to care. I'm sure he's just used to it but that's gross!","Two attempts to get the food we ordered. Not a smooth running process. Carhops not checking on orders after delivered. Bathrooms a bit on the yucky side. Been to  a lot of well run Sonics. This one could use a refresher on service and cleanliness. Food was okay.","Tasty milk teas but very stingy on the actual tea. 75% of the drink was ice. Sorry but for $5 it's a rip off.","After some sampling of a few flavors of ice cream, I decided to go with the raspberry cheesecake ice cream with a waffle cone, and surprisingly I didn't enjoy the ice cream at all. It wasn't anything special, and my ice cream melted very quickly. I'm an ice cream lover, and I was not a fan of this location at all.","We went to Culver's for the first time and when we got our food the order was wrong so we had to go back in there to get the correct order the second time there was hair in our burger very disgusting Never again.","Had the Churro Caramel Crave and the churros were over cooked in the microwave and destroyed my desert experience. Nice kid who made it but maybe they should have fresh churros instead of microwaving frozen ones. Disappointed because I love Cold Stone but I honestly wasted my money.","Way too greasy for my taste. I like some grease on my pizza but not to the point where the pizza box is falling apart because it is drenched in grease, yuck! The cheese they use isn't so tasty either. I'm all about the cheese and it was so bad I ended up taking it off. That's no way to eat a pizza! Next time I will try Aiello's.","Ice cream is ok. Service is terrible!!!\n\nThe server gave someone a wrong ice cream cone. The customer took a bite and returned it. Server then proceeded to actually put the ice cream back into the container! We proceeded to point it out and they could not care less.","Meh.  For the price and the lineup, I feel it is not worth it.  Passed by and the lineup was not bad so I decided to try it.  I had the Shiratama sundae which did not leave me with any lasting memories of the place.  Try it for the novelty, if you happen to be in the area but I would most certainly not venture to make a special trip to try it.","Recently came here with my wife. The place seemed very disorganized and chaotic. The ice cream and everything just okay. My wife got a sundae and by the time she received it the ice cream was already melted.","Not too sure what the hype is all about. Everything is pre determined on the menu and they do not do any alterations. I had asked for no chocolate syrup on top of what I had ordered, the lady behind the counter was rude and wouldn't even do that. It was way too sweet and ended up going into the garbage.","I had a cheese burger here last night. The patty tasted as if it had been heated more than once and possibly had a visit with the microwave, no flavor and chewy.  The service was great and the food came out fast (yay, for microwaves!) but I will never return.","So bummed right now ordered a steak and egg burritos didn't check my order until it was too late for me to go back and I ended up with a bacon burrito and I can't stand bacon (I know who doesn't like bacon) so now I'm hungry and grumpy :( I'm giving it the extra star because the strawberry lemonade slushy I got was really good!","As a customer nobody should ever feel like they are being made fun of because they dont know what comes with what. As my first time the employee was laughing at me because i was asking what came in a salad and what sauce came with the cheese curds. That is not professional at all. I am not feeling this type of way just because im feeling this type of way because of an employee. Anyways id rather choose mcdonalds than this place again.","Negatives include excessive prices. Large Sicilian pizza, steak hoagie and 2 small beers shouldn't cost  $47 before tip. Steak hoagie was good, but not enough meat or lettuce and tomatoes very hard to find and overpriced. The pizza was very good however","The food is absolutely dreadful. I ordered a cheeseburger and it was undoubtedly not only the worst cheeseburger but probably the worst meal I have ever eaten in my entire life. The place has this really strange odor when you walk in, and I should have left when it hit my nostrils. However, I thought I would give it a chance. Big mistake. The service was good.","I have now waited 45 minutes for my acai bowl, this is the second time I have waited extremely long times at this location. Never again.\nUpdate, found a hair in my acai bowl. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.","I have been to several nektar locations and unfortunately this one is consistently falling short.   Long wait times, lack of consistency in the items, out of items all the time.   Today I was given my drink to me with juice down the side and coming out the top - I had to clean it up.   Management - where are you?? I won't be back to this location.","Got the rocky road in a cup. The chocolate soft serve is not good... like it was formulated to stay solid (almost spongy) so the toppings stay on. Nuts were good. Marshmallows tasted dry and stale.. they were not good at all. (Marshmallows in general go dry pretty quickly if left out in the open). Cashier service was fine and smiley, but the cone creators were cold.. and I don't mean in temperature. \n\nWould not go back.","Super disappointed. Treat myself to ice cream or custard nightly. Went last night and ordered a concrete with peanut butter cups. Got home, started to eat it and realized there was no peanut butter cup in it at all. Luckily had splurged and gotten hot fudge and peanut butter as extras so still had the flavor.","Ice cream and topping were frozen rock solid. Frozen so hard they were covered in frost. Took awhile to thaw enough to even get a bite. Flavors were not robust at all due to the extreme freeze. Almost like freezer burn. First time here. Not a fan.","Cool concept. But the ice cream literally started melting 2 minutes after getting it. So I wasn't able to finish it since it was melting all over my hands.","I was honestly pretty disappointed with this Toronto location. I've had Taiyaki in Miami and it was amazing there. This time it did not taste as good. Also the seating area was very dirty and the floors were sticky. We actually had to ask one of the workers to come wipe down the bar type table as there was no way we were going to be able to enjoy our ice cream on a sticky dirty table.  I don't think I'll be back.","Amazing ice cream bad customer experience! They are in too much of a rush and didn't get the order right and then proceeded to argue about it.","It's juice. Nothing special about it. Overpriced. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Have been in twice and both times have left very disappointed. The employees, especially the shift supervisor are rude and do not belong in a customer service based job.","Loud R&B music in the front competing with the loud rap music in the back I guess for the dishwasher. I even asked the barista to turn down the music. It's impossible to study here!","Went there for a açaí bowls after paying the employee at the register. I walk to sit down and watched the lady who took my money grab my food for the açaí bowl with the same gloves she grabbed my cash with !!!!! \nIt was so loud in there the lady could hear me say change your gloves . \nThat's one of the grossest things ever and unsanitary!!!! \nI will never be Back!!!!!","Very small stingy portions! I've tried it a few times hoping it would get better, with no luck. They even gave me a portion that looked awful due to air being in the machine. It's a shame this place isn't a reliable ice cream shop.","waited about 40 minutes for my order to be done for it to be not cooked all the way. Front desk employee sneezing and coughing, and NOT washing hands. very disappointed.","I love going to Culver's! BUT tonight I was disappointed my burger was not  even warm, location was not as clean as usual and the carpet really needs to be replaced. NO WIFI! Really it is time for a remodel.","Was here a week ago... loved it... came back the guys got 5 customers out ... disappeared in back - wait 10\". No communication to me or the couple behind me... this is crazy.  20\" no Ice cream no communication!  Won't be back","Went for lunch and wasn't impressed.  I had the double sonic burger with bacon.  The fries were just mediocre and the burger really wasn't anything impressive either.  The only thing that gave this review a second star was the Cherry Limeade.  Honestly a great drink too bad the food couldn't be on par.","I'm only giving it one star because I cannot give it zero stars milkshake factory you suck dude how do you have a milkshake or an ice cream sundae and not offer chocolate ice cream by serving Perry's ice cream you have prevented the other milkshake restaurant on Carson Street from using Perry's and I can get chocolate ice cream there you have lost my business. I plan on sharing this with everyone what a horrible  business a ice cream and milk shake place that does not serve chocolate ice cream.","Called in for a request and received an extremely sarcastic response, when all I requested was the availability of a product.  Maybe the lady was in a bad mood, but she should leave that at home.  I won't be going here anymore and will tell my colleagues who visit Toronto often to avoid.","This place is overrated and the ice cream isn't good. I'd rather eat Costco soft serve. But the best is Bang Bang ice cream on Ossington. Skip sweet Jesus","As an ice cream fanatic, of course I had to come here. I've tried their mulled pineapple drink, burnt marshmallow latte, the cotton candy ice cream, and the birthday cake ice cream. This is seriously just an overpriced vanilla soft serve with fancy toppings. It is not all that special unfortunately. I love the creativity and work that encompasses the menu items, it just doesn't taste as good as it looks!","Sat down for one second and opened my computer while I was waiting for friend to arrive, and owner immediately came over to me and shouted, \"Ya gonna get something?!\" Made me feel immediately uncomfortable and unwelcome.","This place is overrated! unfriendly staff. mediocre waffles, and the price is severely inflated! save your money and have dessert elsewhere.","Still don't get it. Stopped by for a few slices with my wife. The pizza is only ok. And the takeout area was filthy - tons of silver pizza trays, plates, etc. not picked up.","Sadly I have to give this location a 1 star due to the poor customer service/attitude of the kids that work here. Been in twice and both times the group of kids that work here make myself and my family uncomfortable. Today was National Ice Cream Cone day, so I was hoping for some smiles or a \"thank you for coming, or come again\" just zero chance. Maybe management will read the reviews and revisit the employees they have working the front counters.","Used to be a good to spot for lunch but they've installed a giant gate blocking the foot traffic.  Now it makes me think twice about eating here.","I like Zoyo, but I'm not sure I would come here if it weren't for the little girl I babysit who loves their yogurt. Sometimes I just feel like their flavors are too processed, and all of their yogurts regardless of dairy content or flavor have high fructose corn syrup in them. \nIf you do go here, try the cake batter or the oatmeal cookie flavors, with toasted coconut.","Mayo cafeteria is typical hospital food.  We don't feel it is anything other than ok.  We have eaten here many time when we have had an appointment and no time to leave and come back.   I would not eat here by choice.  The food is blah and unless you add  spice of some kind.   I love Mayo but not the food!!!","It's expensive 11-12$ for waffles and ice cream with 1 topping. Banana topping is 3$....... you can buy a whole rack of bananas for 3$\nMy friend got strawberry white chocolate waffle and guess what THERE WAS NO WHITE CHOCOLATE. \nOverall, is it worth your money? No. Just get a bubble waffle at pmall and buy yourself a whole rack of bananas. \nTasted aight tho","Awesome ice cream and amazing flavor combinations. However, the service was something to be desired.\n\nThe two workers (in their teens/twenties) were very unenthusiastic, detached, and even rude. My group and I were very friendly and tried to even converse with them. I understand people have bad days but it was enough of an issue to leave a bad taste in my mouth regarding the whole visit.\n\nI love ice cream and like Coldstone, but I don't like feeling unwelcomed.","Really? You should train your employees on basic customer service, at a minimum you need to have basic manners. We are sorry to have spent $29.84, she even forgot to apply the 20% for four on Friday...so sorry we interrupted your texting, Sam? Maybe is the reason why your place is empty vs the crazy mocha coffee shop next door!!! Never again...","Horrible service. Walked in and got dirty looks, no smiles, all workers looked miserable and had attitude the whole time. Not welcoming at all. Will not be returning to this location. David F and the two other girls he was working with on June 22nd  at 10:50. Teach him how to scoop ice cream also because he sucked.","Placed an order online, received a confirmation email, waited 2 hours, no delivery, called to see about the order, was told that they never received the order, staff was not accommodating, will not be ordering again from here.","Terrible service. The girl that took our order was absolutely rude and did not show proper customer service at all. She gave us attitude the entire time and also got our orders wrong. We ordered a matcha milk tea float and a taro milk tea float, and she brought out a matcha milk tea - no float - and a thai milk tea - no taro and no float - and was arguing with us saying that that was what we ordered when we both said float and taro not thai tea.","The place is an absolute disaster. There are no signs indicating the different areas. Staff is grumpy and huffs at the guests especially the lady at the cash today. \n\nThe place is not organized \n\nPeople in their bikini are allowed to enter  into the eating area which is not very hygienic","First time trying this place out. My shaved ice looked nothing like the pictures on yelp and they were out of everything. Very disappointed","I just left and it took over 15 minutes to get to number two's through the system.\nYou're in a car sitting outside in 105° and it takes over 15 minutes to get to hamburgers this is absolutely out rages","I see why this one only gets 2 stars by others. I give 1 star because they couldn't even get a simple request of no cheese on a burger. Not a big deal for most but being lactose intolerant it is a big deal. So way to go Sonic on Baseline Phoenix.","Two weeks in a row I stopped by in the evening and tried to use he drivethru. Both times no one greeted me and I resorted to driving into a stall. After pushing the button there I was only greeted after the two employees talking to friends outside decided to end their conversation and go back inside to work. Very disappointed.","I will never come back to this Dairy Queen and will continue to pass along to the public the horrible service I received 4 times. After discussing issues with a manager and her being completely incompetent this restaurant needs help. I feel bad for your future customers and will steer people away from going here. \n\n-Cold Food \n-Wrong Items \n-Workers using profanity in the back\n-Unsanitary \n-Unprofessionalism\n-Poor Management","Manager from 33 degree frozen yogurt victorville\n\nhonest review, it has been 4 months, everyday I must unplug the machine because of the motor fail and I do not have the answer to this solution. Why the machine has motor fail everyday. My facility has aircondition during the business hours. .I want to sell yogurt not fixing the machine everyday.\n\nI want the machine to replace asap.","Bathroom is SO dirty. Not like it got dirty since it was cleaned yesterday; the sink looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months. There are two employees working and not very busy, yet the machines and counters around the yogurt machines are filthy, maybe they are wiped down every day, but it doesn't look like they are. I've decided not to eat yogurt here.","Staff was friendly... but DO NOT ORDER THE BOBA. If you want boba just drive to one of the Tempe spots. Order Jasmin tea that ended up tasting more like milky water. Yogurt wasn't bad.","Had the Culver's Deluxe and it was dry! And the fries were from the freezer. Can't believe how different each location is. Next tome, SMASH BURGER!","1st visit chili dogs were good. 2nd visit the ice cream sandwiches had ice crystals in the ice cream. 3rd and last visit the chili dog was not even cooked. They put a cold uncooked hotdog on a bun and poured hot chili over it...yuck!!   Next time,  I will drive to the hotdog restaurant near Tempe Towne Marketplace.","Is \"butter burger\" actually code for burnt to a crisp burger? Meh. And the soft serve isn't as good as DQ. 2 stars because the servers were very nice.","I usually don't have many complaints when it comes to ice cream but I was pretty disappointed with my first Handel's experience. I opt for sugar-free whenever I can, but theirs had a very strange grainy texture. It was fine for the first few minutes but it got to a point where I just had to throw it out. Maybe stick to the sugar'd up ice cream.","Don't bother.  Get your ice cream elsewhere. A simple change in topping will have you getting a lecture on the cost of things.","Showed up at 10:35 just to be told they closed at 10:30. Hours are not correct on this website or the employee needs a new job.","Came all the way here for the gelato this holiday weekend. Subpar gelato don't know why people gave abt it.","I ordered the tandoori platter with a can of soda. I got the meal but not the drink. They had poured hot sauce over the chicken and rice (the latter tasted like minute rice anyways).\n\nThen I get a call that the guy is there with my drink, 15 minutes later. Wtf?","Not as wonderful as natives to these parts make it out to be. Plus what is with the baby slices? A big let down if you ask me...","Been there once and the service was horrible. And don't bother trying to make a to go order because calling 4times isn't enough to answer. GREAT PLACE LOL","I went there on a Thursday and the place was set up like a school cafeteria. The soccer game was on and it was really lout and the people there looked intoxicated.  The food was awful.","Worst cold stone in the valley. Disgusting and dirty. The only thing worse than the rude manager is the evil owner. Will never go back.","Icy, but greasy mouthfeel. Generally disappointing. If the vanilla ice cream isn't good it means the ice cream base isn't good. Not worth it.","It was a nice beautiful place. Fancy looking, but not that expensive. The service was not great. They were very slow. Gelato is just average.","Well my ice cream was very freezer burned and horrible I can't eat it, it's that bad. When i called after bringing it home and trying the young lady said there was nothing she could do. I won't be back to your establishment. I am a paying customer and I bet if they would of tried the ice cream from the health department you would not of got an A","Green tea softserve sundae and mille crepe both very average or below average. Sundae was extremely disappointing with filler ingredients whip cream and stale waffle crumbs below.","Was visiting from Louisiana during the 4th of July and we stopped in for an after dinner treat. Unfortunately, we weren't impressed. There was a line out the door and it was busting at the seams with people so we assumed it would be great. However, the lady behind the counter seemed miserable and wasn't friendly at all. The ice cream was expensive and it wasn't good quality either. Crafton Ice Cream Delite on Steuben was our favorite!","This review is strictly based on the service at this location. Very poor management. Huge line out the door with empty seats inside. People come in and order take out and sit at the tables and eat it. The hostess is no where to be seen. Waited in line for 30 minutes until I asked a server if we could sit and she gave us menus and took our order. Very disorganized.","The shaved ice here was not great. I've had shaved ice so many times, and it's the first time I've ever left most of the shaved ice behind. The black sesame ice I ordered didn't have much flavor- it felt like I was just eating ice. No complaints about the mochi topping and condensed milk glaze though.","This location always closes before they're supposed to. No idea what the reason for that is, but it's pointless to go anywhere near closing time....","I came to royaltea on last sunday and tried to order lightbulb matcha bb tea. The co-worker told me all customers before order the lightbulb bb tea put in the deposit of $20 first and then can be able to order. I decided purchase the drink. The tea quality taste like p mall $2.99 which i can not accept. No next time.","I was there today (7/13/18) and a lady crashed her car into the cement wall that surrounds the dumpster and not a single staff member went to check on her. All 6-8 of them laughed and smirked at her. It was so horrible. Luckily the lady was okay and walking and talking but ugh seeing them literally smirk at someone who was in an accident is heartbreaking and sickening","Love this location \nBeen here since I was a child came here with my dad and would get these cute little children's cones \nSuch a sweet memory I have ..but they go back and forth with butterscotch dip for cones to not having it yo having it to not the butterscotch is my favorite if I want one I have one I have to drive to the Scottsdale and oak location. .. so bummed I really wish you would bring back the butterscotch dip for cones","Drove all the way from downtown. But the bubble tea here is way below my expectation. Coco or share tea all do a better drink. You also need to deposit 20 dollars for a light bulb tea. If you live nearby, it's okay to stop and grab a drink. But definitely not worth driving here for it. Lastly, they always ran out of deserts no matter what time during the day...","My husband and I ordered the same size, regular. What is wrong with this picture? I think one of us got shorted. $20 for 1.5 servings is ridiculous. We will NEVER be back. Please rid yourselves from our neighborhood.","Incredibly bad service.  Orders constantly screwed up. They advertise that they are open until 10 (now 11) but they actually close at 7.  Unmanaged line ups. Tables outside not cleaned up.  Creating a lot of damage to their brand which is too bad as it is pretty good in Europe. Too bad as the coffee if prepared right is good. Needs new management.","In my opinion, it was gross. Fried meat covered in rice. Meh. I could do better at home. Came here on recommendatiin and bummed I went.","The owner makes people so uncomfortable by following them around and not letting them pick the samples and also stands there and stairs at people. \nHe also act unprofessionally and rude to kids. \nYogurt does not taste good either. \nOver all experience was horrible.","This is my third visit to Phoenix. I have come to this establishment for ice cream in the early evening, tonight being Wednesday, and the same woman has been here each time. She is super unfriendly, if not downright rude. I figure that three times is enough and there should be a review to acknowledge this. Ice cream good, wait staff sucks. Get over it, woman. Management: alert!","There's something wrong with having to pay $5 for ice cream that isn't flavorful. I much prefer Dave & Andy's - their waffle cones are amazing and you'll pay under $3 for some of the best ice cream you'll ever have.","The hours say they are open until 9pm. Not sure why the lights are off and the blinds are shut at 8:30. I can clearly see a young guy inside. Smh","Frost wasn't bad, but I won't be returning.  I saw all the good reviews and was disappointed.  I have been to a couple of gelato places in the valley and had tons of it in Italy.  This doesn't really seem as good, and I personally don't think it compares to gelato in Italy at all.  I would go to another local gelato place before this one.  The decor is nice, but that's not what I am looking for.","Worst dessert place so far. Decor was the only thing that was nice. Service was slow. There was no music. The waffle on my ice cream was almost burnt and hard to eat. Very disappointing.","Terrible service. The waitress was rude and unfriendly. I felt like I was rushed out of the store and did not feel welcome at all.","I didn't see what all the hype was about this place. It was mediocre at best. I guess because it's located in an Airport and it's convent. Other than that, I wouldn't waste my vacation calories here at this place.\n\nYour friend,\n\nOB","The managers in this location here are grumpy ( most of times very rude grumpy, always such as Nick). Customer Service doesn't exist in this Deer Valley location, if you would like to experience and see grumpy rude people, stop by! :)","Horrible customer service. Gave the order to the wrong people. They wouldn't make another order and closed. Unreal","This is not gelato. Do not go here expecting authentic or even remotely near authentic gelato. A quick stop for regular ice cream on King Street? Sure great. But it is not gelato.","Not a fan, everything was just off with my meal. I had the souvlaki meal to go and can't say I was satisfied. The meat didn't taste very natural, and the tzatziki sauce made things even worse, and tasted like it had been out awhile. The side of rice was small and instead they give you a whole bunch of salad. Not great value for the price. At least the service was friendly.","I was looking forward to it, but was sorely disappointed.\n\nI'm not really a fan of the texture, especially with the coconut milk base. I ordered banana flavor with brownie bits. For the price I paid, I expected more of the toppings. Additionally, the service was  sub-par. So, I don't think I'll ever be back.","Took over 15 minutes to order and receive food also food was cold and very tastefull very disappointing","To expensive for what you get ! I'd rather go to 31 flavors!  To me they are  the best. My daughter talks me in to go once  in awhile and I'm always sorry!","Great smoked meat and friendly service, but not a sandwich worth $10. Think of a ham sandwich with processed cheese and ketchup then add more ham. The flavor is mostly \"salt\" and the pickles are mushy.","Went to Sweet Republic in Sky Harbor Airport. Ice cream was decent, but they are incredibly cheap with serving size. Give me a break! Smallest scoop of ice cream I've ever seen. I usually have to tell I e cream places to give me less because the scoops are too big. This was ridiculous! Plus they weigh it out like they're a pharmacist. \n\nPathetic!","Horrible tasting chicken. Toonie Tuesday from Popeyes or KFC is way better. Expensive for what you get. The patatas bravas were a soggy mess. The chutney wasn't even chutney at all, but some jerk gravy. Chutney should have a jam like consistency.\n\nWill never be back and will tell everyone I know","Tried it today for the first time and it was beyond disappointing. It's all looks and cool pictures but the flavor is worse than basic. The horchata is overly sweet, we also tried the Del Mar and the Rose and it was nothing but sugar. The staff is friendly, the decor and atmosphere are great but I definitely wont be the back","When you arruve you have to sign yourself in on the waiting list. The service was good. However, the desserts were not that great.","Inconsistent fruit quality. For mango/strawberry Bon Bon there's a large chance that you would get the sour ones. The fruit purée also doesn't worth the $$ you paid. The cream was falling apart and melting as I was trying to finish the BonBon. It ended up pretty messy. \nOverall I would never go back.","4 of us waited 30 mins for the coffee, got up and left, totally ignored the whole time.","Snoh has an interesting product. It's very mild and subtle. Now that I've been there twice and watched the guys crank out their desserts at a rate of about one every two to three minutes I find the establishment too frustrating to patronize again. It sucks to watch your friends finish their dessert before yours arrives and then have them look bored while you eat yours. \n\nYour subtle, understated product seems empty, flavorless and overpriced to me now.","Be aware they do not accept Milkshake Factory gift cards. They do not tell you this until you order and go to check out. Who doesn't accept their own company's gift cards????\n\nPoor customer service and actually fraudulent. I was sold a gift card I can't redeem.","It looks interesting and fun but it so cold that your tongue goes numb and there's really no flavor.","Very poor service at this location. Today at 3:30, I sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes and the line never moved. Finally, the person ahead of me got out of line and I was able to as well. I do not recommend this location","OK, the coffee appears to be \"fair trade,\" but have you checked out everything else there?  Glance in the dumpster when you're leaving and see what you think.","We got yogurt last night and found a hair on one of our toppings. Let the owner know we had hair on our kiwi. And all he did was remove the hair. Did not offer to give us a new yogurt. Disgusting and bad customer service. we will never go back.","Ordered the doo doo waffle and the dough was still slightly raw on the inside when it got to my table. Very underwhelming. The only redeeming factor here is the novelty of the toilet themed decor.","Dirty, bad service, expensive and bad food.\nWhen we told the waiter that the donut in the milkshake was stale, he responded that \"they buy them and sometimes they are not good!\".\nI guess the cafe theme, extend to the food they serve. \nNot worth the time and money.","The staff was rude as hell. I told one of the staff I would like to switch to another seat because there was something in front of my leg which is giving me pain. The staff was so annoyed and told me if I can see any empty seats then sit there. Yes, it was busy but she did not need to be rude.","This place is the dirtiest restaurant I've steeped foot in, bathrooms were wet and mouldy . Garbages overflowing . Floors looks like they haven't been mopped in weeks . Staff are not customer service trained . No napkins in dispenser....disgusting to say the least","Green tea soft serve tasted good.  The things that came with the sundae tasted like nothing so I am not sure what the purpose of them were.  Just surprised the portions for a $10 sundae was so small.","Ironically, everything but the fries and burger (patty) was good. I have no idea what the rave is about. Fries weren't good at all, the burger patty was a pancake (get the double, the single is a joke) and the service was slow. Just moved here from San Diego, was hoping to try some new joints... this is not it.","Not what it used to be... it's not worth it anymore. \nThe workers are not friendly whatsoever. The queue lacks organization. The portions are minuscule. It got extremely pricy. The ice cream doesn't taste like it used to when I was a kid. It's No longer my go to place for ice cream.","Employees are rude and lie! I see many other reviewers have said the same thing. Stay away from this location if you can, there are two other in the area I have never had a problem with.","No chicken fingers at this location no frys or toast as well? I got the chicken sandwich and it's terrible. Cost me $9","The sauce was good, the crust was good, but the cheese was too thick & did not taste delicious. It made me gag. Pretty disappointed with this sloppy pizza & it didn't live up to the hype surrounding the name. \n\nIt might be the worst tasting pizza I've ever put in my mouth. I threw the leftovers away. What a waste of money.","After hearing all the hype and much anticipation, I dragged my daughter to go with me and was I ever disappointed...went in past 11 at night, no line ups but I had to wait more than 20 minutes for two egg waffles! Wonder why Firstly the matcha mochi egg waffle was too soft and could not taste the mochi at all...then came the taro mochi that was hard and burnt! \n\nSorry to say but will not recommend or will I try again","the lady there is very rude i definitely don't recommend going here she gives you the worst attitude","So disappointed. We have walked by here many times . The pictures and videos of them making desserts look so appealing. Not so when you get the real stuff. Sorry looking ice cream rolls made with cheap dollar store food items. Broke six, yes six, spoons trying to eat it. They could have at least supplied better quality plastic spoons. Don't even bother.","Update: still one star experience but I also want to mention that hygiene is a major issue in here. It's totally disgusting to have the same person serve the ice cream and handle the cash. This place should follow in the footsteps of Eva's down the road - credit only. Flavours were still a bust for me this time as there's honestly not much differentiation between them. For example, vanilla and malt ball crunch tasted basically the exact same. I don't get the hype.","Yes, the waffle was soft and sweet, the toppings were yummy--but the dirty feel of the place and apathy of the young man waiting on us makes me not want to go back.  No customer service at all.  Hate to say it, but that's what really sealed the deal for me.  Blah!","Not worth the time to line-up and certainly not worth the price. I am better of grabbing a tin from the grocery store","Theree is no Cherry in the Choco Cherry blizzard. It ruined my life","I despise this place. Cheese curds are disgusting. \nI think this is literally the only place that has ever made me fear that I was going to go into cardiac arrest after leaving. \nI haven't tried the custard, which is supposedly what they are best known for, so I can't rate it on that level, but the food is really gross.","After having lunch upstairs at Daisho I decided to try out their soft serve cereal milk ice cream. After paying almost $7 I noticed how small the cup was. I liked the taste of the ice cream but the cereal flakes did not taste good. The flakes tasted too salty and didn't go well with the cereal milk ice cream at all. But since I paid so much for a small ice cream I had to finish it. I'm still regretting how much I paid for a small ice cream.","The frozen yogurt here tastes artificial and its always packed with kids. The sample cups are inconveniently located in the back so you have to go against traffic to get them. Annoying. I only come here when I have a desperate craving for frozen yogurt because its the only yogurt shop in my neighborhood. I have been to all kinds of frozen yogurt shops and imo Yogurtland is the best.","If I could give them a zero star review I would. Based solely on the service they managed to give me a completely wrong order and then proceeded to tell me that what I ordered was not even an item on the menu. Which it clearly was as I checked the menu and even the sonic website. The servers were also rude as well as slow as it took me twenty five minutes to get my order. Try an avoid this sonic location if you can.","I've gotten Rialto delivered a few times, and it seems to get worse each time. Tonight, on a very not busy Sunday, I received ice cold fried mushrooms and a pizza that looked like it had been tossed around and stepped on (all of the toppings and cheese had slid off, and the dough was smashed up against the opposite corner of the box). They're nearby and convenient, so I've been giving them second and third chances, but I'm officially done ordering from here.","We stopped for ice cream at the Creamistry at 100 E. Camelback on Sunday, Feb 12! The ice cream itself was delicious but the facility was filthy. The staff was very busy making ice cream but none of the tables had not been wiped off as well as the serving counter. We also noticed that the production area had not been wiped down as well. Considering that you are paying about $5-$8 for a dish of ice cream you'd hope that the facility would at least be clean!","I tried to love it, had a chocolate chip cookie and milk once, and was satisfied.. took my date here after lunch next door and went all out on a vietnamese iced coffee ice cream and red velvet cookie sandwich.. the cookie was too hard and made it not enjoyable for me =(\n\nBut the ice cream was delicious !","Soft serve ice cream was only OK. It looks amazing but the taste is too sweet and the portion is just way too much for one person to handle. Sugar coma levels.","Price was pretty high for a burger, fries and a drink. $8.00 and some change. The burger was good but I'm a big guy, thinking this is a snack for me. I can't see a family of 4 going there for less then $25.00 for lunch.","The owner of this place is rude. He talks to everyone like they are kids. Even though he is the owner of this business he acts like he is doing you a favor when you come there to buy something. I feel that his behavior reflects how the management treats the employees. You can feel the negativity in the service. The first time I have eaten ice cream and not been happy. Next I time I will get my ice cream from Frys.","Taste is below average, go to butter baker, it is a lot better than this place. Regret....","Disappointed. As compared with original store in Kyoto in Japan, the shiratama sundae was way too small. I understand it when I think about the importing cost.   \n\nBut more than that, the quality of shiratama made me disappointed. I was the first customer on that day and  some shiratama were soft and and others had hard edge. I guess they were left over from yesterday or not preserved well. (Not soaked in the water) \n\nIt left bad bad impression for both service and quality.","Meh. It's rated so high and I'm not going to say it's bad. We got the strawberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. And they were good. Not great. Not terrible. Why no bathrooms for your customers? That seems a little crazy. We spent $10 on ice cream and they couldn't accommodate a restroom. For kids. Come on, man. Or come on, Millie.","Not worth going if you are not in the area. The server was speaking very lightly, barely hear her. They ran out of tapioca and the bulb is only available if you have a seat. I rather go to chat time which is in the next plaza, or even have thai ice cream.","My experience with this location was not good. As mentioned by others the workers act like it is a pain to serve you and waste a lot on the board. What really bothered me was that the dipped waffle bowl my wife got tasted awful and the ice cream was melted and didn't taste that great but no customer service: they would not remake it or provide a refund, not even an apology, just \"you can still eat it.\"","Not sure why the high reviews. Ordered a hot chocolate and the Bruge. The strawberries were mushy and over ripe. The hot chocolate was watery and had chunks of hard not edible looking pieces in it. The waffle itself was good though.","Worst service, the waitresses run around with their heads cut off, and the restaurant was not half full. We got our food in stages, not all together as it should be. We were celebrating mom's B-day, and because of the service and less than average food, it was a disappointment! Do yourself a favor avoid this place! Minus 5 stars!","This place was absolutely filthy when we went in this past Sunday. My wife said it was a gimmick and clearly it is. That being said, people were waiting for up to half an hour for ice cream. We bailed after seeing the state of things and got some great ice cream in about three minutes. No one appeared to know what they were doing at all and certainly did not take the time to clean up. Hopefully, it will close soon.","To owners: you're running a business, not a hobby. If you can't bother to update your business hours on Google in 2019, at least post your business hours on your front door. Unposted hours is something I expect from an unregulated street peddler in Thailand, not one of Pittsburgh's top pizza places.","Love the charm of the place. I only wish they had a burger that did not taste as if it were boiled. And yes, I tried this place a couple times wanting to like it.","My order is wrong literally every single time I come here.  Lesson learned, won't be back.","So rude and was so unprofessional,my wife told him it was our first time can he suggest the most popular he was like no didn't give any samples so yeah, I understand the names being unique but no info on flavoring overall will not go back and was expensive","Walked in here on a Saturday morning and it smelled like rotten eggs. Rather get my water refilled by Glacier outside the grocery store than subject myself to that odor.","Came here for the trendy black ice cream and that's all it was a trend. I did not like the taste of it and regretted driving out of my way to come here. It only got a 2 star because there was no line up and I got a cute insta pic out of it that's all.","I typically love this company. However, I have never dealt with more rude customer service. They regularly close early and get upset when paying customers try to order within an hour of closing. Not to mention, they never put fudge on items that call for it and deny customers items listed on their board because they claim that they don't carry them. I will not be returning.","I really wish the mic didn't have a mute button because the guy taking our order was cussing at customers in the drive through... If you don't like your job, find another one. Awful customer service and crappy ice cream. Oh and a tip for the employees based on my experience and all the bad reviews I've read (obviously isn't a problem just tonight) try smiling once and a while or treat people with respect.","The counter girls don't pay attention and are too busy laughing. The pizza had too much sauce, not enough cheese. It also sucks that it's cash only...","Drinks had an odd taste and lacked flavor. The boba wasn't very good either. We did use an alternative milk (one coconut and one almond milk), but it still shouldn't cause the odd taste as I have been to other Boba places and used the same milk alternatives.","Unfortunately, this place was a huge disappointment. From the cute Instagram photos, and the interesting popsicle design, it makes this place stand out on the map. However, the popsicles in the case were old, and had a layer that had obviously melted, and been cooled again. Left a slimy layer on the exterior of the popsicle. If you're going just for the instagram, then it's the place. If you actually want to eat it, then I would suggest Zoyo yogurt across the street.","This place is not organized at all. If you're gonna order a piñata don't rely on this place. I had ordered mine, I got here and it wasn't ready when it was supposed to. All they keep saying is a little longer. It's been over an hour.","We arrived at 10:51 and the drive through attendant stated that their kitchen was closed and they couldn't serve food. The location closes at 11PM","Bring lots of money, $6-8 per person for a small serving is ridiculous! We had the turtle thing, it was good but in no way worth that kind of money.  You've priced us out of ever coming back.","I'm a fan of Cafe Mocha and I order that cafe with soy milk instead of regular milk as usual. OMG! that's so bad. I have never got cafe like that before; the taste really bad; and won't be back for sure.","This place was closed for a month and on its Yelp page it said it was open. Very disappointing as we made a special trip down to try it -- very unprofessional!","They changed their baker and the new one is just not as good as the previous one! Very disappointing as their baked goods are over $4 dollars a piece! Won't be buying any more goodies.","first...hair found in sushi roll. second...screaming children. EVERWHERE. third...food was flavorless (except the 911 roll, which was very spicy and the best part of our meal).\n\nservice was ok. until it got busy, then we felt ignored.\n\nso much for fusion sushi. we won't be returning.","With the world of yogurt and yogurt-like joints popping up, It seems that TCBY has been left behind. It's not bad, per se.. just uninteresting. \n\nStaff a this location were sweet.","I was excited to try this fudge after reading all the reviews! Unfortunately I was disappointed. The fudge was not good and the customer service was awful.","My girlfriend and I went here just before closing. Several homeless people setting up shop here. \n\nFood: Ordered a couple hot dogs and a basket of tots.\n\n10 minutes after ordering: Grills broken, no hotdogs. \n\nWe got the tots and sodas free of charge.\n\n3 stars for the service. -1 for the homeless.\n\nTots were still good though.","If u want a fried burrito roll come here. This is not sushi !!! Service was horrible and the prices were outragous ! 9 sake bomb ??? thats crazy !! Real Sushi places are @ $6 dollars max. I only give 1 star for the TV' s and music. Really stay out from this place if u are a real sushi lover cuz ur not gonna find any real food there.","Just left this cold stone location and it was the worst experience I've ever had at cold stone. People are normally really happy and enjoyable to be served by but the girls I just dealt with were not. I ordered a love it and received a like it and once I told her she still charged me for her mistake. It's unbelievable how horrible this customer service was.","Is this place for real ?  I really don't miss my school cafeteria ice cream socials from when I was a kid.  Very basic."]},"ATTR28":{"id":"ATTR28","name":"rating","_cid":"id:G_BOh7KXCmp8WMvA","clientKey":"","description":"","precision":2,"deleteable":true,"editable":true,"values":["positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","n

And I'm now going to be a loyal customer, there smoothies and different shave ice is AMAZING!! I recommend this place to everyone!!!","Love coming here for their super long chili cheese hit dogs and a refreshing drink!  So many delicious drinks to choose from on these extremely hot days here in Phoenix.  I park, eat, drink and am happy.","Custom ice cream. Ordered a \"Chocolate Devotion\" without the chocolate chips (too chewy) and they asked if we'd like extra brownie pieces in place of the chips. Of course!.  Great service.","Always fresh ice cream and have a bunch of flavors available.","The best popsicle store in all the land. It usually takes me a good ten minutes just to choose because each pop is equally as delicious as the one next to it. I don't even live in Ar","Melttttttttttttttttt my heart :)))) \nI love it here, cute hole in the wall. I got the mint chocolate chip in a Chinese to go box :) with a fortune cookie. we sat outside, people watching. I like it here.","Their custard is amazing!! I usually get the vanilla with strawberries and bananas for toppings.\nI tried their buffalo chicken for the first time and liked it. Crispy and spicy. \nTheir butter buns are soft and delicious.\nLove this place, must stop in whenever I come into town.\n\nService: amazing. Everyone is always extremely friendly and warm.","Love love love this place. Super chill vibe, phenomenal customer service, but most importantly, house blend milk tea with boba, TO DIE FOR","The ice cream was great and the waffle cones were amazing! Check out the seating in the back","I really love donuts and I really love THESE donuts!\n\nThey have a big selection and some.of them.are just hilarious... like the Captain. Crunch donut or the Fruit Loop donut.\n\nAnyway, these guys are great and you should certainly try them.out!","My wife and I were only in Phoenix for three days and we ended up at MacAlpine's twice. It was that good. The shakes were great, the sandwiches (hot and cold) were great, the potato salad was great one day, but so-so the next. The music was right, the decor was right. The waitresses were prompt and friendly. The soda jerk even wears a paper hat!","Wow, this place is exceptional!  Some of the best ice cream I've ever had, and they use whole pieces of fruit and nuts... I understand why there is always a line outside!","Amazing little place in a quirky neighborhood serving unique ice cream and out of this world donuts. I could go on and on about Novel. Definitely the best glazed donut I've had in a long time. I love how light and not to sweet  these are and they make the perfect \"bun\" to sandwich a scoop of creamy ice cream between. The owner is super hospitable and sincere, and makes you feel welcomed. My family and I can't wait to go back!","A cute smoothie spot around Kensington Market ! I was able to make my own smoothie from their available fruits and vegetables or you can make your own. I liked how they had ginger and added it to my smoothie for a sharpness along with some lemon (with no added sugar !) I love how this place is so transparent about what goes into their drinks and don't load them up with added sugars ! \n\nCute atmosphere also ! Very well decorated.","The Kinako Daifuku tasted unique in a sense the outer layer is thinner and the interior tasted so fluffy with almost a whipped cream texture. Normally I don't have a sweet tooth, after a few bites I had to check the sign to see what ingredients were inside and made it so nicely done.\n\nMy yuzu drink went well with it. I will come back to more Kinako Daifuku!","You will NEVER find waffles tastier on the east coast than the ones served up at Wafflelonia. The inside however and seating area needs work. Furniture barely passes as furniture that is conducive to comfortable. The staff really never seem happy and will hesitant to help explain anything to you if it's your first time. Lucky for them their waffles are to die for. Love that they use Andy's ice cream. Heavenly.","Hmmmmm.  So far this has been the closest to the taste I remember from all the trips to Italy.  With the heat in Phoenix and this cool snack really help you forget about the weather for a short time.  I wish they have this place closer to me but each time I'm in Phoenix I have to find an excuse to visit this excellent Gelato spot!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Good gyros at a good price.\n\nAfter passing by this place everyday, I finally decided to go in and try it with a friend. We were surprised to find that the food tasted much better than the restaurant's decor suggested. I had the chicken gyro with pita. The meat was tasty, lettuce crunchy, and sauce was dripping on the table (sorry). The portions are also quite large (especially for the price) and I was VERY full by the time we finished.","Simply the best frozen yogurt in Toronto! This location is one of the best I've seen in the world. Cool design, great staff, and the best tasting froyo as usual! Pinkberry is sooooo much better than the rest.","Much too expensive for my tastes (definitely a sometimes place), but gol-dang, if this isn't the tastiest matcha latte I've ever had.\n\nThe tea is slightly powdery and sweetened to a tasteful extent. The foamed milk blends into the light, powdery matcha in one contiguous swoop.\n\nSo good I'm just going to see if I can start making these at home.","Not only is the ice cream some of the best in the city, they have Lactaid at the counter so I can still treat myself, and the music selections playing in the shop are top notch.","This ice cream is really good! It is literally made on a freezing cold surface & rolled then put in the bowl. The service was great, friendly! There are so many flavor possibilities! You really should check it out! \n\nIn PV Mall, enter through the SE door by Thai Basil & Zales. \n\nWe will be back for this sweet treat!!","Most awesome, this locations drive through menu is horrendous lacks a lot of the menu items. So you would either have a good memory or not get to know all their yummy items, I'm thinking the owner is cheap to offer a better menu board to order from.","No doubt the best pizza in Pittsburgh. The pie speaks for itself. I love that they have expanded with a bar too. Great happy hour specials and game specials. Can't beat a mineo's pizza, cold beer, and a Pittsburgh sporting event together.","Not a bad flip joint,  tiny but nice layout for the dining.  Average price.  Good tasting food, id come bak for sure.  N I definitely gotta come bak for the sigsig a la cart it loooks bomb!. The breakfast menu looks delicious also...","I got the Mango Tango. Six rolls of Thai mango ice cream topped with mango chunks, mango sauce, mango popping boba, whip cream, and strawberry pocky sticks. It was a mango overload in my mouth and I was loving every second of it. The wonderful thing about QQ Thai is that the customers have the choice of as many toppings as they would like on top of their ice cream.","The best waffle cone I have ever had, also the coffee ice cream was insane! The staff were so nice and it was a really cute spot to go grab some ice cream with a few friends","Amazing breads  (sour dough, challah and raisin breads) great lemon squares, cookies, brownies....\n\nNice staff.\n\nWish I lived closer.","Definitely our favorite ice cream spot in the north. SO many fun flavors and everything we have tried has been delicious. The employees are always friendly and are very generous with the scoops! 4-5 benches for seating around the side and it's typically plenty to accommodate whatever crowd is there. \n\nSome favorites: spouse like a house, Cookie Monster, vanilla caramel brownie.","So, I graduated!! I was in Toronto for 4 years... and living pretty close to Greg's ice cream but shamefully... never have tried their famous ice-cream!!\n\nso I decided to one day, walk in... by myself to try their roasted marshmallow flavor.\n\noh..\n\ngod d ness!!\n\nits YUMMY!! I like it!","I loved this little ice cream spot. The flavors that they had to offer were unique and delicious! I had the rosewater lychee ice cream. It was tart and refreshing, not too sweet. The golden oreo ice cream was sweet with lots of texture from the cookies. I had both of these between a birthday cake cookie which had a nice lemon touch to it. \n\nAbsolutely loved this place. Would definitely go again.","I go at least once a week. My favorite is the Panzanella Salad, best in the city by far.","Expensive for charcoal infused soft serve roughly $6 but I loved it and would return the next time I'm in the area.\n\nMake sure you eat the whole thing at the bottom of the cone is this white soft marshmallow melted down.","Best ice cream in Pittsburgh.\n\nI love Dave and Andy's. The smell of the place is enough to draw a crowd from miles. With delicious and often experimental flavors there is always something new to try. The price is right too. The only SMALL complaint I have is that the place is a little run down inside. It's kind of dirty and small.\n\nTry the sweet cream-- it will change your life. Highly recommend.","This place is IN-credible!!! Went for the first time tonight and had the best service and the best ice cream... probably the best ice cream I've ever had. The owners were awesome and chatted with us about how it was made, all the awards their flavors won, and just fun facts about their business in general. Run, don't walk! Deliciousness awaits.","Love the toxin flush!!  Great service, will make special orders too!  My kids love it!","Went there with three kids. The service was excellent. The ice cream was great and the kids had fun choosing from the many delicious flavors and treats.","Never disappointed by the icecream and flavors I can add. Whether I want chocolate with more chocolate or something random. Great place.","Amazing ! \nI love their pistachio gelato during summer time ! \nTheir service is great and the place is always clean! \nI love all their locations but this one is my fav!","This is the place to go if you are seeking a beautiful trendy insta pic. But most of all; all the ingredients are fresh and natural. Everything is prepared in front of you. You can pick from the list or you can create your own. While you are there, if it's not too busy take a photo in front of the angel wings. NYC ice cream trends have arrived in Pittsburgh.","Probably one of the best matcha ice cream ever real green tea flavor. I can come.back here again and again","That thing when you realize you've spent the amount you would have on a fine meal on ALL the chocolates...of course, I'm still enjoying some of those delights almost 2 weeks later so it was worth it. Omg all the flavors\n\nI purchased bars and chocolate covered citrus peel and some case items. Everything I sampled was delicious. Everything was well labeled and the staff was helpful without being pushy.\n\nSeriously very very tasty.","Fun experience and great options! Love that you can choose your base milk on these! Highly recommend :-)","This is by far the best thing I've ever had! Anyone visiting must go! It is so good. I got the waffle with one scoop each of cinnamon ice cream, Nutella ice cream, and speculoos ice cream!","Their Arizona Sunset drink was amazing! I added the tapioca bubbles and thoroughly enjoyed the taste and appearance of it! My boyfriend (who doesn't normally like bubble tea) ordered the Strawberry Green Bull drink and added the popping bobas. To add bubbles to your drink it adds an extra 50 cents but is well worth it in my opinion. Also loved the cute flower wall photo op! Will definitely be visiting again!!","Sweet place. Good yogurt, good mix ins.\nI like how involved they are in the community  - they have a community bulletin board you should check out, and last time they had some crazy fundraiser.","We had Mineos cater our holiday party.  We ordered way too much food but everything was great.  Pizza, salad, stuffed banana peppers, lasagna, garlic bread, chicken parmesan, etc..etc.  Check out their special catering menu!","Interesting choices of tea and smoothies and fruit ice bars. Delicious. Nice atmosphere. I could def. hang out here and get some work done too if needed.","The best sweets everrrrr!!!!!!! only downfall is the staff- not very friendly... but hey, the delicious cupcakes make up for it!! :)","We went here twice. The first time we got the sundae and chocolate milk shake and second time we got chocolate milkshake again. The milkshake is pretty thick, which is my favorite. The ice cream is average compared to other ice cream shop in town.\n\nThe self-order kiosk is no available in the store","Awesome service and great pastries. They are not overly soaked in syrup. Definitely best sweets in AZ!","So so good, even the cookies were fresh and tasty! The ambiance was so cool too! \n\nSo so good, even the cookies were fresh and tasty! The ambiance was so cool too!","iHalo Krunch offers some unique ice cream flavors that are worth a try. We went to try the charcoal ice cream and cone but ended up with a charcoal and ube twist cone. It didn't disappoint although the ice cream was so tall we couldn't eat it fast enough to keep from tipping.","Caramelo Roll is to die for! This is was our first time coming here and we enjoyed all the delicious rolls. The environment is great, everyone is so friendly and our kiddos really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back when we come back to Phoenix.","I don't care about the long lines. I would wait as long as I must for this deliciousness. It's really a wonderful phenomena and the ice creams themselves are simply delicious!","This place was so good. Everything was so fresh. They freeze the ice cream right in front you . The owners were so nice. I highly recommend this place!","Absolutely loved my first experience! Not only was the atmosphere great, but the service was outstanding. Our cashier asked us if it was our first time there and gave us the background of what to get. There are so many options but my boyfriend and I decided to get the strawberry cheesecake one and I must say it was pricey $10 for one but it  was good and it's a total shareable size! I can't wait to go again and try my ice cream in a chocolate bowl!","Seriously, this is A plus ice cream!  \n\nThe line, however, was so long that you would think that ice cream was a new invention introduced at the 1876 World's Fair.  It wasn't.  Hyperbole. \n\nIt was forth the wait!  The vanilla that I swiped from my kid was spectacular!","Excellent ice cream, gelato and sorbet.  A great spot to satisfy your sweet tooth.","Best pizza place in squirrel hill.  They might be a little more than other pizza places but they are certainly the best in terms of quality.\n\nSometimes the employees can be a bit rude, but the pizza is always great.","Awesome vegan food that won't break the bank. Definitely recommend.","Place is fairly cute and it is a great place to hang out with friends. I ordered the strawberry tea and it didn't taste like strawberry at all, and my friends ordered their other tea's and they also didn't like them as much (a bit tasteless). I remember going here quite a long time ago, and I would say just stick to their shaved ice which they are really known for!","WORTH THE WAIT \n\n(If there is a line) \n\nI had the 'very berry' in a cinnamon sugar cone w/ vanilla soft serve , and ... it changed my life . The cone was soft and crispy , and the workers kept the line moving quick . The space is tight , but whatever ! The food makes up for maybe having to eat outside .  \n\nCan't wait to go back :)","We took our three grandsons here today for ice cream--what a find! It's a terrific ice cream shop with a wonderful neighborhood feel about it. The guy who served was also unbelievably patients with our 9-year-old twins who took FOREVER to chose what flavors they wanted. Oh, yes, & the Hershey ice cream was smooth & tasty!","Simple, honest ice-cream. Had the butter pecan with salted caramel. Not too sweet, not insecure in its culinary proximity to frozen yoghurt, and sensibly portioned. \n\nLike the outdoor patio seating; wish it was set up less as a quick stop and go and more as a place you can get a cup of ice-cream with a friend and chat for a while.","Churn is AMAZING!!! Homemade Ice cream, coffee, and baked goods... Oh My! \n\nSeriously though, it is a great way to end your night at Windsor/Churn. \n\nYou have to try the coffee ice cream affogato style... they pour a shot of espresso over the top... genius!  So good! If you like ice cream sandwiches they make them for you right there with the home made ice cream and cookies. Really, how can you go wrong???","Love at first sip.  I am a boba nerd.  I really love it.  Really fresh and yummy,  melty, boba in perfect milk tea.  Ok, gotta go.. trying the snoh next!","This is a must stop place whenever we're Pittsburgh! We've done nothing but talk about how delicious the food was since our last visit a year ago. The pizza is outstanding! The lemon rosemary chicken wings are to die for! We actually took two half-baked pizzas home with us to hold us over till the next time we can make the trip to Pittsburgh. Super friendly staff, too!","This place is amazing! The ice is so soft & not crunchy & flavorless like most. The flavor doesn't sink the ice like a typical sno cone. My favorite is cherry. Great customer service & prices too!!!","Exposed brick, check\nBad local art, check\nRock and roll tunes, check\nSpeedy wifi, check\nDelicious Mistos, check\nCool crowd reading magazines and working away on macbooks, check\nPLENTY of outlets, sweet!\n\nThis place seems pretty swell. Exactly what you'd want for a cafe work sesh or a man date.","This is my college experience rolled into a single scoop of cookie dough ice cream on a waffle.cone with an M&M at the bottom. \n\nWe came in on a blustery snowy day, it was near empty for a Sunday afternoon, but the smell of waffle cone couldn't keep me away from the nostalgia. \n\nStill yummy. Even in the snow.","Perfect old fashioned soda fountain!\nThe fam and I are visiting from Cali and our daughter wanted a shake. Yelped this place and - wow!\nVery laid back atmosphere. Wonderful young ladies behind the counter scooping, mixing and serving every manner of sundaes, shakes, sodas, you name it!\nOrdered a burger and potato salad and the burger is homemade and huge! The potato salad is like your mom used to make! Stuffed but satisfied..\nGreat find!!","dis place iz so manie mudda legeit cant wait 2 be here","I visited Melt with low expectations. Boy was I wrong! The flavors were inventive, vibe was chill, and the price point was very reasonable. Love this place.","Millie's is fantastic! Today was my first time there and the the ice cream shop is adorable! They had a good amount of flavors to choose from and even quarts to take home! I got the pumpkin pie which was to die for! If you get a waffle cone they will even put a marshmallow in the bottom! It's reasonably priced and located right in market square! It's hard serve but not too hard to enjoy! Highly recommend!","I loved this place! So many unique flavors I wanted to try, but ended up getting the honey lavender and my date got the mint chocolate chip one. Bit were phenomenal!!! We walked from an apartment downtown; not sure if it's a good thing or bad thing to be so close! I may frequent this place too much!!! The staff was really friendly. Super cute little shop, can't wait to go back!","This place is the bomb! Great ice cream. I def recommend it! Totally hip. Not In the best area. But you know what. That's where the best places are to eat! 10 thumbs up","So good and so perfect on a hot day. Service was great, even gave both me and my daughter kid sized scoops.","We stopped here for mid-day snack.  All 3 of us got the sundae while my father-in-law had a soft serve matcha green.  The place is pretty small in terms of seating.  Also, their credit card reader wasn't working so only taking cash.  Overall, it was a decent sundae but preferred to have better seating options as well as flexible payment.  However, there is a bathroom which is a plus.","I enjoy the ambience of this pizza joint, along with their beer selection. \n\nThe pizza is tasty, though it's pretty greasy which seems to be a Pittsburgh thing! \n\nService is fast and efficient!!","This place is soooo good ! I definitely recommend it and the staff was so nice  I'm definitely coming back !!!","Great place that has not only a large variety of donuts to offer but also sandwiches, smoothies, and a lot more. Service was friendly and just overall outstanding. Donuts were still warm since we were there at 6:30am. Flaky and delicious at a very reasonable price!","Pretty overpriced drinks but def worth it. This is by FAR my favorite boba place in the valley. LOVE their crispy spring rolls with sweet chili dipping sauce! Also, the avocado smoothie is really creamy and tasty (it's a blended drink). My default drink is the coconut chocolate over ice with yogurt popping pearls. It always smells good in here, too, and is super light and bright and open.","Top shelf pie. 1st time visitor and I fell in love with the sauce and the crust. I can see why they keep winning best pizza in the city. Only took about 20 minutes to order and get our hot pizza at out table. Liked being able to buy a beer as well. A little pricey but hey I wanted one with my pizza. Loved it.","This place is my favorite ice cream stop ever. Their real mint chip ice cream is hands down my favorite. They always have great and creative flavors which makes you want to come back and try them all! I had a choice to go anywhere for my birthday and I chose here.","Awesome place makes me feel like I'm a kid again getting ice cream.  Yum.  Every flavor I try is good.  Love the Cookie Monster flavor.","Very good place! i recommend the fresi-nieve. and with ice cream of your choice! very good mexican restaurant for deserts and just a good time!","First time here tonight. The young girl working the counter was AMAZING! Best El pastor tacos! I want to go back for more right now. I can't wait to go again!","Ordered the Taro bubble waffle with mochi plus taro ice cream and mixed berries.. To Die For!!! I am definitely coming back. Delicious and order to made.","Stopped here after work and I loved it. Excellent customer service. I got raspado as well as a tosti elote. Both were excellent.","good selection of paletas, also has ice cream, licuados, mexican snow cones, cockteles de fruta, as well as tortas. I've only had their paletas, which appear to be made on the premises. the pecan one was great!  I only wish there were more people here.  in the right location in the right city, the store would be booming.","Seriously delicious!! A friend suggested we give Churn a try while on vacation in Phoenix and I'm so glad we did! The ice cream is creamy and full of flavor! The salted chocolate chip cookie is amazing! I had it with a stout ice cream and the flavors did not disappoint!","Legit place for anything matcha! Would definitely go back. The serves look very well thought of and perfect every time. The staff are also polite. The desserts and drinks are more expensive but the quality is there so it's worth it.","Me and my girlfriend were randomly in the area on our travels when we ran into this place. I gotta say it was super great. The place was clean and the food was incredible. Great Mexican dishes, plus they had Asian dishes as well, not to mention all of the desserts they offered. I highly recommend!","Yum! First time in. It's not the Mexican fried ice cream you think of but rather freeze fried! \nI ordered the pineapple with caramel & almonds. It was SO good. My fiancé had the Thai Tea with almonds & Lychee =equally delicious. Super clean, friendly team & it's fun to watch your combination be prepared. Will absolutely be back.","Great fresh juices of your looking to kick start your cleanse or take a massive do0-do0","Stopped by Sunday 12/02/12. The girl working was nice, friendly and very professional. She was great explaining the flavors and promotions shop has. I tried the plain tart didn't do much for me. By contrast I really liked the Fruity Pebbles which I've never had before, and the Salted Caramel Pretzel. The shop is kept very clean, nice clean bathrooms, plenty of seating outside. I will definitely stop by on my next trip!","Always the best Pizza in the world. The sausage is different than anywhere else. Aiello's doesn't even come close.","Far and away the best bakery in the city that also happens to serve the most delicious ice cream; just tried the bourbon bacon and can officially die happy! Also some of the friendliest staff who have offered to make me their carrot cake with no nuts if I call ahead and even opened when they were closed because I looked sad outside their window! Simply the best!","I visited the shop for their ice cream sandwich in the summer when the line was out the door and it was definitely worth it. They make their own ice cream and cookies\nI recommend getting the sandwiches cut in half as it's easier to eat 2 halves.\n\nOn a more recent visit I had their chocolate cake which was perfectly moist, and a good ratio of cake to icing. \n\nJust a heads up: the place doesn't really have any seating in the winter.","Ice cream is bomb. Especially the bourbon caramel toffee crunch and honey lavender flavors. Oh, and the donut sandwich is quite ridiculous. My only regret is stuffing my face with too much pizza at a pizza joint beforehand, so I didn't do such a great job making room for more scoops of ice cream goodness. Then again, my tummy would've disowned me. Staff is super friendly and genuinely happy to be there. Will definitely be back to try more of their decadent flavors.","I found out about Greg's Ice Cream a few years ago and I have been a returning customer since! There is no other place that can make marshmallow ice cream so well and I think it is worth the effort to come here whenever I want marshmallow ice cream!\n\nService: \nService is always friendly and quick. \n\nFood:\nThe ice cream has a consistent smooth creamy texture. My absolute favorite is the marshmallow and second favorite is the mocha.","We tried the chocolate sorbet, fudge ice cream, vanilla ice cream, cinnibun sammy with cinnamon toast ice cream and an Americano coffee. Everything was delicious. Great place for ice cream, desserts, and coffee. There's a little space for indoor seating and a few benches outside for seating. So glad we skipped the other places we passed in our walk to this place. Yum!","Amazing pork Sisig! If you love Mexican food you will love this place. Even if you don't have a Filipino GF to drag you here. Hahah. Oh she's picky on her Filipino foods.","Pittsburgh has some of the worst pizza... But I came here at someone's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised: REAL Neopolitan-style pizza to be found! Was like biting into a cloud topped with good quality mozzarella and tomatoes. Will be back. Again and again...","Amazing nostalgia and history here in Phoenix.\n\nThey have done a wonderful job curating some vintage shopping as well as an extremely tasty menu!\n\nThis place is as close to real magic as you can get and genuinely feels like being transported back to another time where things were simpler.\n\nWonderful friendly staff and great location.\n\nThis is a 1000% must visit in Phoenix.","I went to Thunderbird high school and have come here a few times and I do like the drinks that they provide. Lots of a flavors to choose from. I do recommend trying this place at least once.","Finally had the chance to try this out and BOY WAS I MISSING OUT. For you sweet tooth lovers, I highly recommend the Birthday Truffles (why did I only get one pack to share??) and the Crack Pie. \n\nLocated on the second floor, their items are prepared already in packages so choose what you desire and pay at the cashier on the first floor. The soft serve is available at the cashier (need to try next time).","What an exceptionally great experience we just had at Novel! The owners were so kind and patient as we tried just about half their flavors and ended up with a Dough Melt stuffed with Bourbon Caramel Toffee ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch on the edges. My gosh it was SO good!!! I look forward to coming back and getting their Mexican Chocolate or Cookie Monster on another Dough Melt or Leslie Knope!","I can't get over how good this ice cream is. Your not just going to buy this for the look of it but also for the flavors. Since we were in Toronto for only 2 days we went on a Saturday and the line was long. After we ate the ice cream we decided it was totally worth the wait. We went back the next day because we wanted to have it for the last time and the line was shorter and very quick. So worth it. You must go!","So weird so good. The staff is always super cool and friendly and it's the perfect dessert to Cherry Blossom next door.","I got to try a few different kinds of gelato. I discovered this place while looking for Salud juicery. I LOVED everything i tried. I wish they sold their gelato by the pint! I will be coming here again.","Grew up on mineo's pizza. Everytime I get back to Pittsburgh, I get up to th squirrel hill location for my slices. Great pizza!","Right next to LA Fitness, Smoothies are all natural yogurt based, don't even use ice and always fresh fruit. They also offer supplements like energy, protein, etc. Awesome.","The hype is real! Ordered the Mr. Grey rolled ice cream ($7 + tax) and was definitely not disappointed! It was refreshing and the portions were reasonable. The staff were friendly and the wait for the ice cream wasn't long. Only concern was that it was understaffed with two people making the ice cream and, one person as a cashier and prepared the ingredients. The process would've been expedited if they had an extra person solely as the cashier.","Owner is brandon and is a super humble dude. Second time I have ever been here and many more times to come :):)","So glad I finally got to try this place. My boyfriend and I shared a full size of the O'Canada. A strawberry egg waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberry syrup and toppings finalized with a maple shaped piece of dark chocolate. \n\nThe ice cream was nice and fluffy and the waffle cone was very good. Soft and crunchy. It wasn't too sweet either.","Lovely little cake shop. It's on a tiny street so it's quiet and shady, an excellent spot to relax from the sun. The interior is modern yet cute and the macha crepe cake was delicious!","So far I have only had the frozen custard...The Pecan turtle concoction to be exact, I would eat 10 if I didnt think my husband would judge me. \n\nWe plan to go back and try the burgers!","Amazing vegan gelato bars!  SO GOOD! Had the coconut and toasted almond.  Some of the best non dairy gelato/ ice cream I have ever had!","We took our three grandsons here today for ice cream--what a find! It's a terrific ice cream shop with a wonderful neighborhood feel about it. The guy who served us was also unbelievably patient with our 9-year-old twins who took FOREVER to chose what flavors they wanted. Oh, yes, & the Hershey ice cream was smooth & tasty!","This place has amazing ice cream and the owner is really really nice and extremely customer service friendly. She opened up an hour late to let me buy ice cream","Great service and desserts! You should definitely visit of you're looking for a quick dessert. I got the#4 and the ice cream is amazing. The Taiyaki is also well done and the red bean adds the right amount of sweetness. Also very aesthetic","Love their ice cream flavors. Lots of asian palettes to choose from. My favorite is their almond tofu. Also tried their hk milk tea which was surprisingly strong & not sweet!","New opened tea house at Finch and Midland. I love the decoration inside the store, peace and quiet. The free WIFI would make me go there more often. I've tried bubble tea; I think it's pretty good as the bubble is soft and sweet and the milk tea is tasty.","Cookie cookie\nEXCELLENT\nVERY friendly and attentive staff.\n30 years for a reason....\nYorkville is in transition, lots of construction and vacancies.","This place is awesome! Fresh homemade ice cream with all local ingredients. Our visit was especially great because our server kandice was so knowledgeable and excited to help us.  I 100% recommend Sweet Republic.","The mecca of pizza in Pittsburgh. Bar none the best the city has to offer. I've had Aiello's, Fiori's, etc- they are great, but none top Mineo's. The cheese is thick, and perfectly salty. The sauce has a nice spice to it that perfectly compliments the cheese and the crust is buttery and crispy. 10/10","We go to zoyo ever few weeks, if not once a month. We love the fact that we can pick out multiple flavors and toppings. Making it open creations. Though I have to keep a close eye on the boy or else I'll end up with a 5lb yogurt with him at the helm. Haha\n\nYelp check-in and you get a discount!","I came here with a friend for a quiet afternoon coffee...and I think I will be coming back for many more times! Very nice atmosphere and plenty of sitting (outdoor sitting is available as well). There is a great variety of beverages and food and it certainly feels as a local, friendly place that you can stop by and see familiar faces and feel comfortable. Even though I live far from it I think I will be visiting Cup Ka more!","This is one of my most favorite açaí bowls I've ever had. I had great service and hospitality.","Shaved ice with amazing presentation, the price is a bit high, but worth the work they put in. They are very accommodating for allergies too, they took back and replaced our dessert with one. They are hand made so it takes some time, but it's worth the wait. It comes with condensed milk and the condiments are layered into the shaved ice, not just on top. Tasty and really good for sharing! definitely would come bacl","They didn't have very many \"unique\" flavors, just your general. However, for sorbets they did. They had champagne mixed strawberry flavor, and one with peach. Wish their gelato flavors were as different and unique too. If you want unique flavors or just more in general to choose from there's the Gelato Spot on Scottsdale Rd, and That's Amore Gelato! :)","I've been to two milkshake factory locations this week in Pittsburgh and it's absolutely PHENOMENAL. Amazing staff, amazing chocolate, and the milkshakes are to die for. I highly recommend the cookie dough fudge! The chocolate raspberry was great too but in my opinion it felt too chocolatey for me but if you're someone who likes chocolate it's perfect.","Worth the line!\n\nI  got Cookies, Cookies, Cookies and Creme cone and it was so good. The vanilla soft serve was covered in delicious cookie and cookie dough bits. \n\nWorth the wait and worth the price.","I got two flavors: Vietnamese coffee and Butter pecan in a waffle cone. The Vietnamese coffee flavor was spot on. It had specks of coffee grounds. It was perfect because the coffee flavor wasn't too strong, and it wasn't too sweet. The butter pecan was really good too. I would definitely go back to try different flavors. I also got a cup of coffee, which was not good. Don't get coffee here. Stick to the ice cream","Delicious. I had the London fog cookie sandwich, and I also tried the coconut taro ice cream and the chocolate ice cream. All of them tasted fantastic.","Stevie was so helpful! With a smiling face, she Recommended my yogurt and it was fabulous!  I will be back!!!","I can say one thing...toasted marshmallow gelato  get it!  Every flavor I have had is really killer!  I went in one day to have my token validated and the owner had me sample almost every flavor!  She was really nice and I've been coming back ever since!","They have amazing rotating flavors! They serve it with a fortune cookie which is an awesome add on. They also serve donut ice cream which is great for sharing. Check this place out for an awesome late night treat.","Everything is good. Everything. So refreshing!\n\nMy wife and I moved away from Phx just as Snoh was getting big, and wow do we miss it. We recently came back from Philadelphia and drove out to Phx from the East Valley just to eat at Snoh. It is truly better than any Snoh I had in Taiwan -- they know what they're doing! We would gladly fly back just to eat Snoh again. Keep up the good work guys.","We ordered the waffle cones, cookies n cream plus peanut butter & sherbert. Was absolutely amazing, we'll definitely be back for the Belgian waffle & crepes. Amazing service. Good vibes, good music & good people.","Yay yay yay! This local chain has finally opened in my hood. I love all of their products. Seriously everything from the massive fudge selection to the different ice cream flavors, milkshakes, floats, specialty desserts and more.\nA much needed and welcome addition to Little Italy!!","Very friendly staff.  We had chocolate malt and half chocolate/Jamaica shake.  Both were delish.","The waffle cone, get it, you will love it!  Along with any flavor of ice cream! LOVE this place.","Sugar & Spice is such a cute ice cream shop. Their ice cream is very good, not as good as Page's but it's up there. The inside is so cute, and is like a little 50's ice cream parlor. I think everyone should give it a try! They also have a candy shop where you can buy candy supplies to make your own candy.","Nice staff very helpful ,explained how to order. Quick professional clean Store. I was looking for an icecream shop and found them. Next time I'm down that way I'll be sure to go back.  That time I'll get the cotton candy custard,  very good.","Bit expensive but pretty decent burgers. Will definitely go again ESP now that I know about the 10% check in discount!","Love this place...clean, great toppings and the staff is friendly. I like to sit outside and watch the city go by....","I love this place. They have the best milk teas. They are always busy but the service is fast. It's a great place to hang out with friends.","Very tasty milkshakes with some interesting (and delicious) flavor choices.  I went for Dark Chocolate Blueberry.  My shake could have been a bit thicker, but it was still Yum!\nStaff was very friendly.","Delicious crepes! And great attentive owner and staff! Great place and cute use of silverware.","It was late, they were open, and on the recommendation of a friend I decided to stop in for a slice of their vegan pizza, name eludes me but it was their vegan take on bbq chicken.\n\nOh. My. God.  It was amazing.  The taste was incredible, crust was nice and crispy and not doughy and thick, and for the price the slice was worth it!","Loved it,  good prices, service and authentic taste!\nAnd this is coming from someone that has been to Tokyo.\nThe matcha taste in some of the drinks is a bit mellow but the ice cream is great.\nI cant believe the negative comments, did not experience any of that. Will go again soon","This is a great place to sit and watch the city go by....the yogurt is to die for and the management rocks.","They have good collection of chocolates. The shakes and sundaes are very tasty","Thai iced tea with condensed milk and boba. Perfection. I love the flaky soft texture of the snoh ice. I want to make sticky snow angels in a vat of it. Be bold. Get red bean or taro. Avoid the boring strawberry.","This was our first culinary stop in Toronto and we LOVED it! Great atmosphere, service, and food. \n\nDo not skip the Poutine!! It's incredible. I asked for the wasabi mayo on the side, which I realize is a little annoying, but they were super accommodating. In addition, we got a couple beers and pork gyoza, which were also delish.","This water and ice is not the newest looking and don't look too clean but ice cream is great, will come back again. Recommended.","Nice place for an Italian dinner if you can walk from home/find street parking. Hubby enjoyed the pepperoni pizza, I got the meatball parm (sooo cheesy) and a salad. Somebody was confused, though, because the waitstaff kept trying to serve my dishes to the lady looking at a menu at a completely different table. They've got a central bar with stools for drinks/food and tvs on the walls playing sports. The front opens onto (covered) sidewalk seating.","I can't believe I haven't stopped here before. The Nutella boba was amazing! I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu.","Best ice cream ever! Great customer service. Definitely lived up to the hype. Black on black is bombbb!!!","So cute inside and the girl behind the counter was very friendly! The baked goods all looked delicious and the prices are pretty standard!\n\nI actually went in and asked if they had apple cider, and they had it! It just was not on the menu! Made my day! \n\nI have it bookmarked to come back and try their shakes!","My first experience with Culver's was absolutely fantastic.  The food was very tasty and the atmosphere was friendly.  The girl (sad to say I forgot her name) demonstrated one of the best customer service experiences I had every had.  I wished I was fortunate to have hired her.  Culver's keep up the great work and give the Culver's Crew a raise for a job well done.","Great little coffee shop! I had their Aztec Mocha which was one of the best mochas I have ever had. The atmosphere is really nice with sugar skull art everywhere and it is super cozy. Plenty of seating inside and out. The staff was really friendly. Great place for morning coffee!","Very tasty, if a little greasy, vegan pizza. Fake meats and cheese make you feel great that a pizza this great can indeed be vegan. I would say 4.5 stars to be more accurate. There isn't much else; a limited seating area, kinda slow, though polite service. But Apiecalypse deserves to be on your radar as a must-try if looking to indulge yourself with some nostalgic local pizza.","This is the best snow ice in town! Very good with lots of flavors and toppings. They have good snow and smoothies","Excellent ice cream. When you walk in you smell the waffle cones being made. We had banana pudding ice cream which was amazing!","The owner, Jim, was attentive and super helpful. Brimley's Water & Ice is the only place I'll buy all my H2O products from! Love their Alkaline water","I am new to Boba and milk teas, an occasional indulgence. I purchased a split tea, one side Thai tea the other was a honeydew. Both were delicious! What I liked most was that they were not overly sweet like other bubble teas I have tried. Nice space and great customer service!","Gelato done right but with an Asian twist! We tried A LOT of samples, they were all so good! It was very hard to decide. It just means we have to go back for more. Both of us decided on 2 scoops--Vietnamese Coffee with Rosewater Pistachio and HK Milk Tea with Peanut Sesame. You will not be disappointed once you've had your first sample.","The yummiest pistachio ice cream ever! We enjoyed every last bit. Menu is awesome. Staff is very friendly. And very good atmosphere.","Having a pregnancy craving my husband and I stopped by after seeing the reviews on yelp. So glad we stopped! The owner was super nice. We had the watermelon and piña colada. Try the powder it is pretty tasty! Can t want to go back and try a different flavor.","I love this place. I wish I could get past ordering my favorite the Pecan Turtle! But I can't, it's just SO delicious. I have always had excellent service. The place is super clean. There are a lot of choices. They have pints to go as well. A must try!!","This place is the best ice cream shop and locally owned. They have unique flavors and they change frequently. I love the honey lavender ice cream.  You have to eat on the patio, but it is a nice space near Roosevelt.  This place is a real treat! I originally found the shop on Yelp! as I wanted a fun, easy treat for my co-workers. We were all raving fans when we were done!","When ever I'm in Phoenix I always Stop by and grab those awesome Smoothies  Best place in town to get your to get your health on","I don't usually review places but when you stumble on an amazing place during the soft opening... you go out of you way to write a review! This place was awesome! Salted caramel \"Diamond bar\" dipped in chocolate along with a lychee boba tea and I'm hooked! I'll definitely be back so I can try all of the delicious looking flavors!","This desert shop came up suggested and I decided to give it a shot and I am SO GLAD I did! The girl working was so friendly and put up with me wanting to try every single flavor. The prices are great. And the Thai tea ice cream is to die for!!! I will be coming back often! I'm excited to try the bubble teas especially. Happy to have a new ice cream shop.","The chicken strips aren't great, but they never are.  You can tell the employees want to be here, almost as much as the average chick-fil-a employee.","I have drove by this place many times and been wanting to try it out. We finally had some time and I have definitely been missing out. There is so many flavors with vegan and a couple sugar free options available. I really liked the place and the price point is great. The place was clean and staff was friendly. I got the New York cheese cake and pistachio flavors.","Came here after a Yelp event and had a blast.\n\nGreat location, upbeat vibe and a great selection of drinks.\n\nWe didn't really eat much asides from a few appies but the menu looked fair and the appies were great! \n\nI highly recommend this place when you are looking to have some drinks, a bit of food and a cool and upbeat ambience.","So good! I ate the entire thing! The ice cream was smooth and delicious! A must try! Pictures is avocado ice cream with puff pastry","It's a cute little shop with tasty desserts. I had the Avita and lemon madeleine. The avita tasted very nice. A little bit sweet to my taste but overall good. The lemon madeleine was ok, nothing special. I also bought some shortbread to go. They were ok.","We didn't know what the huge lineup was about until we eventually got to the counter just before they closed at 11 PM. \n\nWe got the campfire marshmallow ice cream, and the London Fog - both in puffs. Seriously so good.\n\nThe marshmallow had huge gooey chunks of campfire goodness, and the London Fog was so subtly sweet I would absolutely have that exact same thing again.","Makes Hershey feel like the RC Cola of the chocolate world. Bigger and faster than the original location (South Side). Shakes, chocolates, all that goodness.","I love this place...everything here is fabulous...its ice cream treats...everyone can find something to love...i know that i have...the owners oncd again have done a fabulous job...this place is crowded for a purpose...because its amazing and fun...i love it","This is a must try ice cream shop. My review is long overdue as I have made it a habit to stop her on my way to the airport every time I head back to Detroit from Phoenix. The diamond bar selection is always my go to with the delicious variety of diamond bar flavors, dips, and toppings. The perfection of this presentation is perfect for the deliciousness of their product.","My wife and I will definitely go back! The waffles had a nice crunch to them and the toppings were simple and delicious. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the coffee I ordered was stale and cold.","Amazing!! I got the milk tea ice cream with the macaron shell, and forget the other ice cream with the birthday cake cookie. I didn't really like the cookie because it obviously for hard due to the temp change (icecream too cold) but the macaron icecream sandwich I loved :) I'll be back! Highly recommend as well!","Mmmmmm. Just mmmmmm.  Samples for the asking and you still won't be able to make up your mind! And then you need to pick what container you want it in! Edible is best. Just saying.","Friendly staff and environment. I got the coffee ice cream sandwich using the homemade macaroons. Amazing!","wow!!!! I had Pistachio Gelato... one heaping scoop, which was more than enough for me! The young lady behind the counter was friendly & very helpful!","I've been coming here for years and Kekou has never failed to satisfy my sweet tooth. My go to flavors: HK milk tea, Viet coffee, rosewater pistachio, and rum & condensed milk. I'm pretty sure I've tried every flavor at this point and none of them have disappointed! \n\nThere's not much else to say about Kekou that hasn't already been said. Consistently good gelato, great flavor offerings, cozy decor and decently priced.","This is my new favorite ice cream place in Phoenix! An ice cream sandwich made with a donut - FANTASTIC!!!\nI have had the Cookie Monster ice cream with the glazed donut twice now... And there are soo many different flavors... I can't to come back again!!","If you like yummy and pretty food, come here! Make sure you check the hours before you plan to go though. I live right by this place and would eat the ice cream every day if my wallet afforded it! \nSeriously, give it a try. You won't regret it!","Nice little ice cream joint. Plenty of seating outside. Ice cream was good. Cookies were good.  Staff were friendly. Will have to make another visit to see if I should have given five stars. I will do that for my yelper family because that is the kind of guy I am. A team player for sure.","My husband and I came here via Groupon because the concept was so intriguing! We were not disappointing and will be returning. You should go if you like Thai flavors and desserts with a bit of a twist. Funky pictures and atmosphere. Cool!","I really wanted some dessert but everything seem closed (what's up with that Pittsburgh?). A quick yelp search led me to this place and YUM. Got some cookie ice cream sandwiches that beat any Diddy Riese (Los Angeles) or CREAM ice cream sandwiches out the water. Decent ice cream with unique flavors and the most perfect of fresh cookies. We also took some cookies to go that we ate for the next two days and they were still as yummy. Highly recommended!","Tons of flavors and always busy... Don't let the line hold you back from going it moves fast . There are tons of topping from fresh fruit , candy bars , cereal etc and most yoghurt flavors are less than 110 calories for 4oz. Get the rewards card for free ;) open late nightly!","It's finally warm enough to visit Rita's and sit outside and enjoy the cool evenings. \n\nThis is a great place to hang out and sip or slurp cool treats and frozen drinks. \n\nWhen the weather is hot and humid even in the evenings, there's a small seating area inside but be warned, it can get busy most nights. \n\nThe chairs are plastic and a bit sketchy to me so we normally sit out in the car or take the drinks to go. \n\nEnjoy yourselves!","Really good taste and my son loved watching it made, aswell as the flavor options. Absolutely the best service. They explained how they make it and made suggestions. Very friendly and lots of fun. Aswell you can walk thru from Sushi Station directly into Fried Ice and Bubble Tea. Great service overall and that means a lot to me overall. We will be enjoying it again. Thank you!!!!!","Love love love love love the drinks here! I am obsessed with Boba tea. Their snacks are also delicious.","Y'all I am in love  this place has so many options and they all sound and look so delicious. If you haven't had the chance to try pop n tea do yourself a favor and go!","Still one of my favorite espresso bars. Coffee is great and the service is excellent. The baked good they have here are very good also.","This is a great place.  We love to go to Rita's for a treat.  The staff is always very friendly, the place is very clean, and the treats are delicious!","VERY PLEASED. Clean and nice environment. Our service was phenomenal. I strongly suggest the house chard and PIZZA. We will be back.","Stopped here with boyfriend for a couple slices and tea after dinner. The tiramisu crepes cake was delicious, moist and just the right sweetness level. On a scale of 1-10 for sweetness level: Uncle tetsus original would be around a 3 and this would be around a 4. Pricing for the slice is around $9 after tax, which honestly could come down a bit (-1 star)","I love everything they serve at this place EXCEPT FOR ONE THING THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE. The ladies that work here should atleast have a smile on their face. Other than that the food is good the place is clean and neat.","Amazing meatballs hoagies.  Like litterally the best one ive ever had.  Nice toasted bun and the sauce is perfectly sweet!  Its awesome that they deliver milkshakes too!  Its also a great location to walk my dogs around frick park and stop in for a slice of pizza and an ice cream cone! The employees were super friendly.. its an all around great place.","Found this by Yelp and came in two days in a row now! The owners are so sweet - the first night he gave us lots of samples before we ordered. If it wasn't for the samples I would not have tried the sorbet which may have been my favorite! The raspberry and orange sorbet was delicious. The second time we had a Nutella/strawberry/banana crepe and a waffle. The owners also let us try their homemade jam....the sweetest shop and can't wait to come back!","It's been hard finding an authentic hawaiian shaved ice in Phoenix. Well, this is the one! Good quality products will make a great shaved ice. Lots of flavors to chosee from and the cap is what makes it perfect.","What could be better in Arizona in the middle of march then ice cream. Churn is a very cute little shop that has great ice cream has well as candy! It's a kid's dream or big kid's dream in my case. \n\nThe smells waft to the restaurant next door and you can't help but lick your lips and drink your beer faster. That's exactly what you should be doing for fresh homemade ice cream and cones that are perfect for Arizona weather.","This place is so good.  Very excited to find a cool place like this for families and that its dairy free friendly.  The customer service was awesome.  Definitely coming back.  We had fun with the games here while we enjoyed our Snoh.","This place is amazing. The whole place is aesthetically pleasing, and their desserts are delicious. I get the matcha diamond bar covered in dark chocolate with a white chocolate drizzle, coconut flakes, and matcha powder. GO!!!","Nearest Sonic and I usually go around their happy hour. Can't beat their specials around that time if you are quenching for some fountain drinks or slushes! I usually get the lemon berry slush, my favorite. Their root beer floats aren't that bad either. Staff is  nice and stay smiling when they come out with your order. Always a plus.","Avoca Choclatier is a hidden neighborhood gem, off a side street near Danforth. I stumped by Avoca Choclatier out of sheer curiosity. It did not disappoint. Luscious chocolate diary free gelato reminded me of a 100% chocolate gelato I had in Milan. I opted for a small gelato ($4.75) with mixed berries and dark chocolate. It was delicious down to every last bite! It's spoon and cup licking good!","What a great name for a company that makes ice cream...\n\nWe're looking for a place that had a local vibe and this place definitely rocked the house servers were awesome ice cream marvelous top-notch great taste fantastic highly recommend the peanut butter ice cream. The facility has tons of seed in the back future is in the front we took ours to go because the place was so crowded and pack but the lines were moving so quick very very very awesome!","I love this ice cream place because of their homemade cones. You can smell the sweet and buttery aroma on the street before you get into the store.\n\nAlthough I like their ice cream, I don't recommend their ice cream cakes. I once bought one for my friend's birthday. The ice cream layers were so hard to cut and the cake layers were so mushy. I think it has been sitting there in the fridge for a few days. Cold stones definitely has better ice cream cakes.","Went here for the first time. I hade the matcha waffle cone and custard stuffed fish shape cookie/pie. It was absolutely amazing!! I didn't want either one to end. I will def go back on my next visit!","Amazing ... so delicious!  Love the flavors, ability to try multiple options .. and that they offer non-plastic options for spoons!  Definitely recommend, good energy here!!!","This place is awesome!! So glad I finally found the local boba spot. The location is perfect (right on Camelback), the staff is friendly, and the boba is just how it should be. Still have yet to try the shaved ice. This place would get 5 stars if they had my beloved green tea.\n\nOverall, best (and only) spot to go for boba in central PHX.","I'm totally in love with the yuzu ice from here and the matcha soft serve is amazing. It has a strong matcha taste without being the bitterness. \nWhat I don't really love is the wait. Some days the lineup and wait can be an hour.","Friendly and the desserts look soooooooooo fun.  You can't lose with candy in a waffle.","I am a big fan of boba and this place definitely hits the spot! Great selection of different kinds of boba drinks, delicious house made ice cream and yummy desserts like their pandan waffles! I come by here almost once a week and get my usual Arizona Sunset iced tea and a scoop of Thai tea ice cream!","Stopped here after a baseball game for Pizza with the kiddos!\nThe pizza was pretty good!\nBreadsticks were also fresh and tasty!\n\nIts a pizza shop, so there's not much else to report.\n\nThey do sell beer (ToGo and for In-house).\nSeating for dining is minimal, but it is very clean!\n\nI'd def stop in again.\n\nParking can be dicey, though  ;)","Oh yum! The ice cream is delicious. The young man behind the counter could have been a little more friendlier but other than that it was a great experience.","After a workout a few doors down, we were looking for a place for a light bite to eat. We stopped into Nekter to get smoothies. I had the health but, and my friend had the mango one. The service was fast, and the store was clean. The smoothies were a good size, and very filling too.","Fabulous friendly staff and vast delicious yogurt selection! We live in the neighborhood and will definitely be returning!","Mediocre ice cream covered in delicious topping! Fun place and the brownie flavor is worth it. Must get the toppings though otherwise it's a hard pass.","Authentic high quality gelato. The perfect treat on a hot summer day. I had the cilantro lime with pistachio. Flavour bombs! And, sitting in the plaza across the street to watch the world go by was lively.","My family loves this place! You build your own and pay by weight. I love the Salted Caramel! They also have seasonal flavors like Eggnog & Candy Cane. They taste exactly like the real thing.","This place is very small.... and very good!  \n\nDon't be afraid of the modest outside.     If  you've never been to a raspaderia before I'll make it easy - get a Chamoyada and the Tostielotes.     Those are vegetarian, but the tostielotes is not vegan as there's cheese and mayonnaise in it. \n\nMy wife and I love walking here after work!","This place has phenomenal boba tea and some pretty dang good ice cream too. Prices aren't bad and the store is always super aesthetic and cute. Friendly staff, good music. Way 2 go milk run.","Excellent gelato. Was here a couple of weeks ago and just got around to thinking about the review. We had a couple of cups of wonderful gelato and actually it was so good that we took some home. Their service was excellent everyone was friendly. I would definitely recommend this wonderful gelato spot to anyone who cares to stop by. It's cool because it's very centrally located and it's easy to the a stop by and have a quick cool treat.","Charming shop shop with great boba. I prefer the flavor pearls, but my daughter lives the boba. We've been to places where the boba has been both under and over cooked . The staff is friendly. My only complaint is that it can take a little longer than I'd like for our drinks, but I'm learning that good things come to those who wait.","Their Banana Caramel ice cream is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth! Delish! Bee Sting is excellent too! I'll be back","This place is a must try for anyone that enjoys smoothies period, vegan or not. Their products are simply healthy and delicious! The service was great service, all employees are proud of the product that they sell. It was so good, we ordered another one before leaving. Keep up the great work guys! Definitely recommend it, tried the Original, Chocolate and strawberry one, equally as delicious.","Friendly staff and great donut selection.","Great burger. Passing by on my way to Toronto from Pickering. The price is right for the quality of the burger. I order the beach burger and I loved it. My fiance order the regular burger and she really liked it too. Most of the toppings are free too.","Really cute place, high quality cakes and ice cream, and very friendly staff. This seems like a great find and a place I would frequent if I lived closer!","This place is AMAZING! I brought my friend from Nashville here and we both loved it! The workers were so friendly and the doughnut sandwich was delicious","Their cupcakes never disappoint! Very moist, flavorful and most importantly, delicious! Their staff is always attentive and friendly. This has become my favorite cupcake place! I drive across town just for cupcakes.","Adorable vintage diner with amazing milkshakes made with Kawartha's ice cream. This place is intimate and fun and I love that it's mainly focused on desserts and milkshakes with occasional savoury options like grilled cheese and soup. \n\nCan't help but feel like I'm in some movie whenever I'm having a milkshake here","cute and yummy\nemployees are cute and kind\nI want to go this shop again\n\nyou can't use credit card\nso cash only","Yikes? Why doesn't this place have more reviews?! Great location! Friendly staff! And of course... Amazing ice cream!","Really unique and tasty ice cream. Doughnut ice cream is the best. \nRecomend 100%\nGreat convenient location close to Downtown.","Their pizza is the best vegan pizza I've had in the entire GTA. In fact, it's the best pizza I've had in my entire life (my non-vegan past included). The staff are always extremely friendly and more than happy to offer suggestions.Their other food items such as their jalapeño poppers are also great as well!","I absolutely love this place. I love that they have a variety of things to do there while you're hanging out having a good time! My daughters have so much fun whenever we play UNO or connect four a while were eating our shaved ice !  I'm super excited about heading to the downtown location this weekend! I hope they have a vendor at the downtown public market as well!","High volume store so the table area isn't always clean. Friendly staff, quick service & great location. Parking is hit or miss so someone better wait in the car! Lol","Recommended to try this place and it did not disappoint! Excellent desserts. Very friendly staff and really nice place to just hang out with a small group to chat and eat cake. I would absolutely love to come back over and over to try the new items. I would also consider ordering a cake in advance for an event, as I'm sure it'd impress the party.","Terrible ice cream. It was watery, the ube was flavorless and honestly not worth $7-$8. I gave the place 2 stars only cause the matcha was okay. The ube was utterly disappointing.","Everything I've tried here is delicious but the customer service is the worst. The older lady with curly hair is the worst. She's been there the most time and she just seems like she hates everyone and her job. Poor customer service is the main reason I don't buy from Oasis Raspados as often.","Wait time was ridiculous and had to stand for 15 minutes once we got our table cause they didn't have enough chairs. Most menu items not available, most things sold out, serving time was extremely slow. The bingsoo is not at all as good as Soul Cafe where they layer the toppings and condensed milk isn't just a diluted tablespoon worth on the side. Meh...hopefully it gets better. Would like to try again.","This place is really run down. The bathroom was beyond smelly and not well kept and just unpleasant to be in. Also there was a cockroach on the counter where you get the drinks. When we ordered our food out drinks were forgotten and we had to wait and the food itself was not as good as other locations I've been to. It really needs to be cleaned up. And the roach is what did it for me, otherwise I would have at least given 2 stars.","The long wait is not worth the bland concoction. We have so many better options in Pittsburgh.","It took about 25 minutes for us to get our ice cream. There was only one group of people ahead of us. The flavor was meh, we all ordered coconut milk. I also saw a worker pick up something off of the floor and then touch our food without changing his gloves. \n\nHonestly sweet republic is better.","8 months pregnant & craving yogurt. we were passing by & figured we'd stop rather than going out of the way for a different place. we made a complete mistake by stopping here. i've never had froyo taste so horrible. the girl who was working was so miserable. other than telling us our total she didn't speak. needless to stay it was a complete mistake to stop here. don't waste your time or money.","The service here is terrible. The young men at this store location are disrespectful and do not do their job correctly. For such a long wait, the ice cream still came out mediocre! I asked for a simple sundae and somehow they even screw that up!","This place is so poorly run, wouldn't be surprised if they close up shop soon. Overcharged for every single item that we ordered, clueless staff, and untrained people taking orders and delivering food. Hope a manager or somebody at the district levels aware, as this place makes all Sonics look bad.  Won't be going back.","Came for crêpe cake. Left disappointed. The cake is mushy, almost soggy. We tried the rose and the tiramisu flavor. The tiramisu flavor really tastes more like cream cheese than anything else. Also the top layer of crêpe is all dried up and unpleasant. Service also poor. Would not return, nor would I recommend.","Don't come here if you're in a hurry! I have been here many times and every single time they never have anything ready. I even had to pull around and park for a blizzard!","Super cheap knock off.  A little bit of an insult. Go in expect one thing turns out to be a family picknic style place","Horrible. My wife and I just don't get it? We tried several flavors and hated it! I had the blueberry and not only was it a very weak flavor, but I thought it tasted like medicine. I also had the vanilla and wasn't impressed. Very dull flavor as well. My wife was also not impress with her choices. We just didn't get it? Maybe it's all the toppings masking it, or just convenience of the location that gets people in there?","The food is overpriced and not that great. The server was actually quite rude to us. She barely looked up when we ordered. The only redeeming part of the shop was the atmosphere but even that could not compensate for the lack of quality food at the given price. I would not recommend this place at all. Go to tsujiri instead.","SOOO bad. Been here twice now, hoping the first time was just an off night. But nope, its bad!\n\nMy wife loves vegan, gf, all natural bakeries, so Ive had my share of these type of desserts, but wow this place is horrible. \n\nBought two cupcakes. They were both dry and tasted stale, and the flavor was off.","Nothing special about this place. I ordered the Bangkok Brownie. Ice cream itself was tasty and would have been special if the chocolate drizzle and brownie bites didnt cover up all of its flavor. \nMy friend ordered the cookies n cream but they forgot to put all the decorating cookies and Hershey's on the ice cream.  Everything was also way too sweet.","I am normally a huge fan of Sonic and this one was really disappointing. I got onion rings with my meal and they were really dark colored and chewy. I ordered an unsweetened Route 44 tea with Peach and it was way too sweet. My co worker had fries with his meal and they cold and dry. I've never had an experience like this at sonic.","I drove all the way from uptown to try this Cafe Bora. But I was disappointed about their cake. I tried their purple yam tiramisu and Hochicha latte. The Purple yam tiramisu has very little cream and big hard cake... and in a small dim sum container... price is $9.95+tax... doesn't worth the price at all. Hochicha latte is way too sweet! I had a lot hope on this one, but turned out so disappointed. I won't return.","A summer Friday nite looking forward to a nice family ice cream outing. At counter order the girl rolled her eyes and didn't even acknowledge our order and walked away. Told coworker she just wants to take a nap. All of the ice cream tubs were practically empty. The milkshakes we ordered were foamy, and the wait time was ridiculous especially considering no line! What a disappoint, won't go back to Betsy's.","$18.00 for a large one topping bland pizza. No flavor crust or dough. I will not try again. Way over priced, highly disappointed. Sauce is very plain, simple tomato sauce. BORING, pass if you aren't starving.","LOL just went into this locations for post dinner dessert...took a 10 minute Uber (have been here multiple times) tonight the girl told us we could only order through Uber eats and she couldn't sell us anything ... HMMM lol well I guess this business hates money in the off season. Won't be back.","On our way out of town, we saw the Hot Eats Cool Treats sign and thought it was our last chance at a burger before hitting the highway, so we pulled in and grabbed some food from some surly teens. Even for fast food, it was pretty brutal, and it turns out there were many better places to stop, including a Burgers Priest. Don't be a shmuck, keep looking... unless you're after ice cream. DQ knows their ice cream.","I used to go there at east 2-3 nights a week get me shakes and French fries. Not any more, the kids they have workin there now tell me the after 8pm shakes are not half off any more since Labor Day, you check\n the Webb site there is nothing to saying that. So I will find me someplace else to go.","The smallest scoop of ice cream I think I have ever had. Great if you are on a diet and shouldn't be there in the first placce. :)","I will give them that the frozen yogurt is good - but for such a small serving, there is a woefully high price. It isn't self-serve, so you get what they hand you, and they'll nickel and dime you on toppings. I used to be forced to get my frozen yogurt fix here, but now that there's a Razzy Fresh on Craig Street, just go there instead.","horrible service. they took my order for my brownie and coffee. served 3 people before me, and completely forgot about me. had to reminded the 3 girls twice","Looks amazing but not very good in my books.  Give me B&R any day... I ordered the cookie, cookie, cookie & cream.  I wish I didn't. The line up was over 40 minutes long and at the end I'm afraid I was extremely dissatisfied and disappointed at the end result.  Just not very tasty...","This is the worst experience I have ever had at any Dairy Queen. I dealt with the manager and she was extremely rude and disrespectful. Will never come here again. Didn't even let me finish ordering.","Decent ice cream but nothing to rave about. The creme brûlée just taste burnt and there's more to the taste of creme brûlée than that. It's nowhere near the taste quality of  marble slab. The system they use to ring people through is ridiculous though. I stood there for about 10 mins, money in hand, while two cashier rang through a myriad of customers because apparently only the person who scooped the ice cream for you can ring you through.","I've popped in 3 times. They are always out of something if not almost everything!!!!! Get it together! I will no longer waste my time going to this location.","This is probably the worse dq there is! We literally ordered 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries. Burgers weren't even warm, cheese wasn't melted or anything. Ok cool they gave us new ones that were hot. Then it tasted gross. Like dirty meat! Idk what is up with this place but I couldn't even finish my food. Reminded me why I don't eat fast food!!","I love sonic, but will never get another blast. I ordered a medium reese's blast with chocolate ice cream, which was really just vanilla ice cream with a little chocolate syrup and a few bits of reese's in about every third bite. From now on I will be going to culvers when I want a treat.","If you come to this location, make sure you pay with exact change or always ALWAYS check. Every time I come here they short change me and don't give me a receipt. I'm done with this location, which is a shame since my Cos school is right across the street.","Disappointed in the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream as it didn't have many chunks of cookie dough, although it was tasty. The coffee ice cream was smooth and creamy with a mild coffee flavor.","I gave two stars because the employees there are always awesome. BUT the store is pretty bad. Tonight we went there and the sewage smell was so bad we turned and left. It was horrible. Don't think I'll go back anytime soon.","Worst experience ever. We ordered an hour ago and are still waiting for our food. When we asked the server for an ETA, they didn't have our order on record. We were then told that they sold out of the things we ordered and we had to change our orders... Don't know if the food is any good yet because we didn't get any yet.","Employee behind counter not very pleasant most of the time.  Doesn't change gloves after handling money.  Ewww.  Probably won't be back.  Have to tell friends about that.  It's a red flag for me.","First timer here. Food wasn't ready.  was OK, maybe expectation was higher because of the reviews I've heard. The customer service was ok - the girl just assumed we wanted a certain side and didn't even ask us what we wanted","Meh. Long lines and subpar product. The novelty is the size of the soft serve, and the weird and colorful toppings.","The first time I tried Apiecalypse in March 2018 I loved it and thought it tasted amazing. \n\nFast forward almost a year and it just isn't the same. The donuts are dry. The pizza tastes like cardboard (And wasn't even put in the oven before given to me) and the customer service stinks. You guys need to do better because Bloomers is just down the street with better quality EVERYTHING","I usually eat here every Wednesday night when Im in town. (EVERY WEDNESDAY ) The last two weeks I was not able to do so because No one would answer the phone. I work next door and therefore usually call in my order as I have done every week for the last 6 months. It is very disappointing that while I can see employees syanding around through the window from my vantage point that they dont want to bother answering the phone . Guess I will have to eat else where","Sadly, I don't think time has ticked in the Gelato Spots favor. Back in 2005, the quality and atmosphere of GS was bursting with flavor and cheerful employees. The last three times I've been to various locations, the employees serve nothing but attitude and the quality of the gelato has suffered and in fact has greatly diminished. It's quite a shame be GS used to be my favorite dessert spot.","Tried their coffee today. \nThey have this huge sign outside that says $1 coffee. But when you think coffee you automatically assume there will be milk to add to it. \nWell the server there didn't think it was normal for me to ask for 2% milk! Instead she pointed me to almost empty container of almond milk and said this is all we have! \n\nCoffee was half decent, experience wasn't!!","Dear Pittsburgh,\n\nJust because you make something that tastes awesome doesn't mean you server it to people with such disdain.\n\nLoose the attitude and this place will be awesome.","A charming local place, but not my personal taste. A bit too much cheese and not that flavorful of sauce. The staff was very nice though.","I can't believe the service here, terrible I'm waiting in line and the server at the counter is striking a conversation with a client. All I here was were are you from? And Bella! Bella. Never again bello never again. You can talk and work at the same time, if you can't find another job like security guard.","OH-NO.. The shaved ice is not as great as before anymore. First, the presentation of it has changed, the fruit is just randomly placing in the plastic cups now, which is disappointed (probably don't wanna hire people to wash them). Both strawberry and mango are not that fresh and as big as before either. I use to come here very often, but now I might need to find a new shaved ice restaurant.","Brought the Mrs. out for a milkshake after dinner tonight and was incredibly disappointed!\nIt seems like you've really downgraded your soda offerings...that Hank's stuff is terrible!\nDidn't you used to carry that Boylan soda??  Like the same stuff that Hello Bistro and Giant Eagle have??","While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt.  I was led astray!  But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door.  I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.","I just went to Melt & the guy did not use gloves or use a TISSUE at least when he got the donut for my friend. That's gross. He had a cold sore on his lip, and those are very contagious. Me and my friends even think he didn't wash his hands, from how fast he got back with the donut. Not sorry for writing this review, just watching out for future customers.","Most of their locations are excellent. This one needs help. Poor customer service and inconsistent products compared to company standards. Four staff members plus the owner failed to greet me while I waited by the online order line. One of them even leaned over the counter in front of me to have a conversation with her friend. I had to interrupt to request my smoothie that was sitting in the fridge. It was the same ingredients as I've ordered at other locations but watered down and less flavorful.","Can't complain about the boba tea quality but I don't know what happened to the sealed cap you guys used to use (and pretty much every other boba place). With the plastic cap, I got drink spilled all over the place no matter how careful I was due to the fact that it was loose and the tea was topped all the way... #BringBackCupSeal","sugar, sugar....nothing special. pricy. nice interior. welcome to scottsdale. I miss my gelato spot","Called on a Saturday. Person who answered was driving. It was requested that we allow a phone call later that evening. This was after inquiring about our requests, needs, etc. We did not receive a response that evening or the following day. We texted a message with another inquiry and requested a response regardless. Three days later and we have heard nothing. Why would I want to utilize this business at this point? Dependability and follow through is clearly lacking.","Japanese franchise serving an assortment of matcha-themed desserts and drinks. They run out of pastries really quickly.\n\nPros:\n* Real matcha taste\n* The intensity of the flavor is indicated by the number of leaves on the menu\n\nCons:\n* THE WAIT TIME! Be ready to stand in queue, and then wait for your order after you've paid.\n* The sundaes are pricey (~$9) for the very small portion you get\n* The cream puff was really stale and dry","This Dairy Queen shows me that it can be worth it to check out yelp reviews for large chain restaurants.  I don't like going to Dairy Queen because it's so banal but banal would be an improvement for this Dairy Queen.\n\nIt was dirtier than my men's dorm room back in college (thankfully since I cleaned up my act) and I ended up paying for an expensive orange juice masquerading as an Orange Julius.","Cute presentation + Green Tea = perfect instagram photo. This is the place to go if you need a photo for your blog. \nMy ice cream cone melted within a minute. It melts SO quickly. My ice cream was soup and I had to throw out my soggy cone. Judging my the two bites I got of my ice cream, it's just mediocre. I've definitely had better matcha flavor before. Would go back to try the shaved ice though.","3 girls were working behind the counter where i was waiting to have my order taken.  1 was busy fulfilling an order, and the other 2 were having a nice time chit-chatting with each other.  After waiting for almost 5 minutes,  i left.","If you're looking for something cool to put on your Instagram, then this is the place to go. I mean, it's black(charcoal) ice cream. Weird right? But honestly, the charcoal ice-cream, and their other flavors are pretty bland. The color makes it look cool, but if you take that away it's just regular ice cream. I would suggest that you try a sample first before you make your purchase...unless you're only ordering for the 'gram.","The customer service was not good. Not very friendly. When I said I didn't want ice in my juice drinks now  one apologized for that. not good and we waited 45 minutes for 4 drinks!! The location at Town and Country NEVER takes this long. Unreal. The app said I would wait 23 minutes. It was 40 minutes and maybe 2 other customers in the store.","I have grown very disappointed in this Dairy Queen. The last 6 months I've gone in and ordered the food was inadequate.\nI had ordered a Strawberry Shake and got some Lemon watery drink. It was absolutely awful.\n\nI will refrain from going there again!!\n\nSadly this neighborhood has gotten so far on the down low, there are no decent places left!","The customer service is really suck. I walked in with my friend and the workers just completely ignored us. Then their friends walked in and they acted totally opposite. Even when they were serving us, they still were laughing and talking to their friends still. We felt totally disrespected. We will never come back again. Not recommended either.","The ube ice cream didn't taste like ube :(. It was also 6$. Didn't really taste like anything but maybe sweetened milk? Wasn't particularly smooth either. I prefer McDonald's soft serve to be honest. I saw the other items too, the shaved ice is $10 and all it has is ice and some little bit of topping drizzled on. Totally not worth it. This is place is a charming idea but needs more ube and more reasonable prices!!","Just bought food here. Didn't like it. I got the grilled chicken with bacon. The chicken was hard in some spots. Not sure how to explain it. Wasn't the best chicken. The onion rings were not great. The cheese curds were okay. \nMy brothers burger was dry. \n\nSmall place, no bathroom.","All I have to say is that the employees hate their job. Hire people who actually appreciate being employed. I get the food industry can be hard but nobody likes a poor attitude.","Sorry Fugo.... I was expecting \"hand crafted\" ice cream as their website states, but I could tell all of their ice creams are from a base mix, and has stale toppings mixed in. Cookie monster is basic, will turn your mouth blue, and the cookies on mine were stale, ice cream had icy crystals. Don't even get me started on the mini donuts.... not one item is homemade, everything they use is store bought. Don't waste your money!","This is the second time that I have waited 15+ minutes for a scoop of ice cream. I've watched meal after meal come out and not one employee has come to my car to see what I am waiting on. I think it is safe to say that I will no longer be a customer of Culver's.","Found it overpriced and service underwhelming.  Kids behind the counter don't seem empowered and know how to deal with a request. Better places in the hood.","My elote was missing 2 of the 4 ingredients and my horchata was okay. Probably won't come back. This is my 2nd visit and the first time there was no a/c","Used to be a regular customer but looks like Demetre is undergoing a transition.\nThe new plating is not very appealing for a desert lover. Paid almost $13 for this plate. Click to see image. Not going back again.","We were really excited to try this place. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. We ordered a Sicilian pizza with sausage and mushroom for pick up. The cheese completely slid in one piece and the we couldn't even hold the pizza in our hand it was so flimsy. To top it off, the pizza only tasted okay. Definitely will it be coming back.","The ice cream was a huge disappointment. Perhaps there was too much hype going into the tasting but I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nI didn't like the vanilla ice cream base. It tasted watered down.","Baskin robins is one of my best places for ice cream, the two stars are for the hygiene of the place. I went to this location yesterday, the floors were dirty, there was napkins on the tables and on the floor. The place wasnt busy but seems no one cleaned them, I stayed there for good 15 minutes and the tables didnt get cleaned.","Vanilla had no flavor whatsoever and something was wrong with the texture. Chocolate was just OK. All 3 of us didn't even finish. Millies doesn't hold a candle to Brusters or even Breyers for that matter.","Really was hoping for better donuts.   They were so so.  Not great selection.  Been there once. I won't go back. Better off at Dunkin Donuts.   Too bad.  They really should step it up.","I feel bad, but man, 5:30 on a Saturday night and you have 4 flavors? 4?? And the vanilla only had enough for 1 scoop. Bummer cause the vanilla was good - but not what we would have ordered if we had more choices.","I was really excited to try this ice cream place considering everyones always talking about how good it is. I was a bit disappointed after finishing my ice cream. It's not all that good, it's normal self serve ice cream with toppings. Also, they only have one size and it's pretty large so if you don't have a big appetite, it's kind of impossible to finish. Don't think I'll be going again","They claim it's the 'best gelato in Toronto,\" but it's far cry from it. Most of the gelati were melting, the line was long, it was expensive, and the gelato we got was quite mediocre.","Attention Groupon users!! They will not accept your Groupon AT ALL! They tell you that you have to go back and deal with Groupon yourself, and you have to pay full retail price. Do not go here.","We passed by this place after eating dim sum next door. The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly. \n\nHowever, the milk teas were a bit disappointing - there was no tea aroma, a lack of creaminess, and too much sugar. \n\nBe aware that the Matcha Milk Tea they offer has matcha and milk tea in the mix, instead of matcha and milk as in Matcha Milk Teas offered at other places.","Total turn off. When I asked for sample cups it was so odd that the teenage cashier had to come out from behind the cashier, walk up to the machine and ask which flavor I wanted to try. Then I noticed her finger tip was completely inside the taster cup as she held them. Gross! She literally had just been at the register. Because I didn't want to proceed with tasters I served myself very small portions of a few flavors and it seemed expensive for what I got.","Went for a quick ice cream as needed that pick me up. Ordered a chocolate dip cone and a large vanilla cone. Their large looked like a medium as other dairy queens make it better and the ice cream had frozen bits inside.  Will not visit the Dufferin location again. Usually we go to Newmarket or Markham location which is great but we were in Downsview so that's why we visited the Dufferin location. Bad location.","This place is awful. I do not recommend anyone to eat here!! The wait was a lot longer than what was estimated and after we were seated they took about 20 minutes to even come back to the table with water or ask if we wanted to order. My dessert was MELTED when I received it. If I could I would rate this place 0 stars. The overall cleanliness of the cafe is not what it should be.","Disgusting disgusting disgusting. The corn dog was made three days ago stale as Hall. Better quality food at McDonald's","Confusing menu and just too expensive.   Single burger. Onion rings. Chocolate malt came to over $10.   And supposedly malts were on sale. I left. Went across the street to in/out burger where i paid $6.  Culver's is tasty...but not for price.","Went for a quiet Family Day brunch with my partner. Hostess & guy server were great, but our regular server was just plain RUDE. MAJOR attitude. Why? Not the first time that service here has been spotty. The manager was not at all helpful, basically told us that we were nuts when we took the trouble to share our concerns with her.  I definitely think that guests deserve better. Do NOT go here, if respectful service is something you value!","I went to Mineo's today for the 1st time. Everyone RAVES about how GREAT the pizza here is.... So I took my daughter and girlfriend and we ordered a Large Cheese Pizza. It was SUPER greasy and had WAY too much Cheese! I lived in Brooklyn for a few years, I know pizza!! This was horrible! This pizza is in the top 5 WORST pizza's of all time, that is unless you like greasy soggy pizza......","The food here is not that good at all... It's a place where you would bring your instagram girlfriend so they can take pictures but you are the one who has to suffer and eat everything..\n\nThe food is overpriced as well and the store is small, I won't be back","Horrible management. On a sunny long weekend they only had one employee working.  She was run off her feet while the manager stood there and watched.  He would occasionally come out of his hiding place to ring in an order.  Someone behind me in the line started to complain and he starts serving them instead of me even though I was first.  One of the worst management/ownership I have ever seen.","Chicken strips were dry and old and French fries were half done will not return very disappointed","Trashy place. Read the reviews on here. I don't even have to touch this place with a long winded review, I flip them off every time I pass by. Still angry a year later.","Let me just start by saying they have the worst customer service I've ever seen. No one at the location answers the locations phone number. I went in for an açaí bowl and I got one. However it was GREEN. WHY IS MY AÇAÍ BOWL GREEN? Green sludge in a cup, just a shame I paid 15$ for this and waited 25MINUTES.","We live within easy walking distance so Friday night we took a stroll up to the new ice cream shop. My wife and I split a chocolate chip and the kids had cookies and cream and something else very colorful. The chocolate chip had nice sized chips but the actual ice cream was lacking creaminess and sweetness , the cookies and cream was a good hit. We will try again but I might suggest adding more chocolate based ice cream flavors.","Sucks when you pay about 8 bucks for a fruit smoothie, that had no real fruit in it.  Slush, ice, sugar, had all that.\nMango peach was disappointing.","Meh.  It's ok.  You're basically paying for the looks and the presentation of the ice cream.  The ice cream itself was kind of bland and didn't stand out one way or the other, and the interior was relatively spartan.  I'd lump this place in with the million other specialty ice cream and yogurt places all over the city.","This was offensive. We started at the noodle bar which has one dessert on the menu. We asked if we should close our check to go to the milk bar. Our understanding was that we should start a separate check upstairs. We went up there and there was no bar... Just a glass-walled fridge with bagged cookies and merch. The temp in there betrayed one thing: days old desserts. This is how a superstar chef sells dessert his restaurant? We walked out.","I am allergic to dairy. There was 1 time I came here and they had non-dairy chocolate frozen yogurt and it was wonderful. I stacked it with toppings and really enjoyed it.\n\nEvery other time I have come here since the non-dairy flavors have been awful and not conducive to toppings. Acai Berry? Yuck. pomegranate berry? No thanks. Can you please bring back chocolate or provide a more neutral non-dairy flavor?","It was ok, but the oreos was soft and stale. It almost tasted like it went bad. I am not sure if it was the yogurt or the toppings that wasn't good. It tasted off....","I hate to have to report this, but having visited here more time, it's TOO DIRTY in here.  Both the seating area and behind the counter, it's in need of cleaning. Seriously. Have a look for yourself.","Not very nice service, my family and I go for dessert every now and then and every time we go the person serving us just hates being there. Don't get me wrong, I know its tough to work in food service but being rude will just make it worse. I've experienced snarky comments and annoyed sighs, sad because we love a good blizzard.","Waited close to 15 minutes for a side salad and a kids meal.  I had to go and get it myself from the counter.  Huge crowd of people at the counter, no one directing anyone to the next available cashier. Very unfriendly workers.","Very disappointed!\nA robot could easily replace the young lady behind the counter.\nA few exotic flavors but, as far as ice cream quality, mediocre.  Save the calories and money!","came here after dinner at my in-laws. i like the little cafe, cute, has character and PACKED. kinda of expensive and tastes like baskin robin's. oh and the day i came here it was freezing. meh, won't visit again.","Great ice cream. I just feel like this store is so understaffed. They are too busy to pay attention to their customers and I've been there on two occasions and same experience. The store floor is really dirty on top of that ( on both occasions same experience). Also the second time we went I ordered a regular size ice cream which is like two scoops and definitely got a small or one scoop and I could t even talk to anyone about it because they were too busy to pay attention.","this is the worst service i have bet had said 15 minutes and an hour and a half i don't have a milkshake. the people working are either on the phone or in the back and they aren't even busy","Unbelievable!!! Yet another disappointing experience at this location!! I've been a regular Nékter customer for at least 2-3 yrs.. the Scottsdale locations are great!! Great service, always friendly and never any issues.. since DAY 1 this location has been plagued with slow service, broken air conditioning, faulty equipment and frankly staff that just don't care!!! We will never be back to this location!!!!","The Poop Cafe is really just for the novelty of having your food served in toilet bowls. The actual food is mediocre ice cream with soggy cereal flakes in a bowl. We had the Ube and a chocolate bingsu which were both really, really underwhelming. But a fun experience if you just want to know what its like eating out of a toilet bowl, I guess...?","This store closed about 2 years ago. I used to go there as it was close by, but the atmosphere was annoying as TV news was always on so I couldn't relax.","Stopped by here with a friend today. The soft serve was good, but it really wasn't anything too special. It is extremely expensive though. It cost $11.50, for two large (not super huge) soft serve cups, with sprinkles on one. Pretty sure you can get the same soft serve/custard elsewhere for much cheaper.","They're creative with their MTO options but I wasn't very impressed with the outcome. The \"servers\" are very polite and it's a very fast process even though the line is out the door. Still, the end product is lack luster and I'd rather go to Bruster's or Handels","They buy their own corn beef they make nothing on site .I ordered corn beef on rye with caraway seeds they don't have caraway seeds they don't have knish or Kiska. Is not a deli it's a ready-made fast food restaurant which is not very good","Had terrible customer service. We walked in at 9:58, while there was a line of people inside, and the lady quite rudely turned us away and said they could not serve us. Won't be coming back here again.","I've had better ice cream in the city and the line was super long, not worth.","Stopped in with my sister one day to grab some blizzards. The inside of the shop is very dirty and seems unsanitary. The staff was rude and their hygiene was lacking. Needless to say, we walked out and went to another location.","Cute decor.  Nice idea.  But, in truth, the yogurt is not that good...something is just not right...I see a lot of people complain about the watering down of the product and that might be why.  I think there is no way having all these public hands come into a place and touch all the machines is going to result in a germ free experience.  I don't think I'll go back, sorry.","Worst service ever! The people working there didn't even acknowledge me and my wife. When I ordered a mangonada it tasted like crap mango slushy tasted like a old mango sitting in the sun. Me and my wife are Mexican and that was by far the worst Mexican raspado place don't go there unless you like crappy raspados!","I have been at this location plenty of times and loved it but this time I ended up waiting a good 10-15 minutes for a berry bowl that ended up being very sour and icy. Extremely disappointed and ended up wasting 10 dollars.","Seven minutes for a shake, seriously there is a Dairy Queen less than a mile from here if you get the chance bypass sonic and head straight for Dairy Queen...","What's the beat kind of topping you can get on your ice. Team? How about some roaches. Yup, this place may have an A rating but just left this place and there was roaches crawling around the ice cream display/serving area. Just gross. And not a sewer roach, the small roaches that are common when things are dirty and unkept. Yeah just sad.","We've always had great pizza, salads, and gelato at Mercurio's. Tonight? Not so much. We were seated at an outdoor table, given menus, and forgotten. Twice I tried to get the attention of one of the waitstaff. Both looked right through me. After 15 minutes of waiting, I went inside and returned the menus. They clearly were not interested in my business.","We popped over here for a snack after a pub crawl and I wasn't wowed by the ice cream.  It was a tasty enough but the texture was off - the mouth-feel wasn't what you expect from ice cream.","Excellent paleta, mediocre customer service. Sweet Jesus does NOT allow substitutions on orders. Even if a machine serving a particular type of ice cream is broken, which is their responsibility, they will NOT make accommodations for your order, despite any dietary restrictions.","Ice cream is not flavorful and rather expensive. It's interesting to see the nitrogen, a good show and that's about it!","Iwas really upset with how my order was all takin wrongly , drive thru man was so rude it's unacceptable  so disappointed , got my order wrong gave me the money back cash but didn't give me a reciept iwas tryan explain to him Nd he just yells at me and says that all the employees heard I supposbly said 2 of the cookie dough blizzards.  I love Dairy Queen a lot but not happy","Sooo tired of ordering a royal blizzard in the drive thru....and there's no freaking fudge!!  These things are 3 ingredients, and you can't remember that??  Besides the medium is almost $6!!  Do your job!","Where's the BEEF?  My husband and I just had a bread burger!  I didn't order a double burger because the pictures made the burgers look so big...not so much in real life.  $6.99 for a value meal is no value either. :(","Looks good, but doesn't even taste like ice cream. I returned it! Also staff was not very pleasant, people serving ice cream should be happy.","Tried this place because of the hype. The store was so small and we had to line up an hour just to get in. The sundae was okay but its overly priced.","Since I was a kid I would always ask my mom to order these for me cause they were my favorite, this place was always the best pizza place hands down! After tonight made me feel sick I went to cut one in half and it looked like slime spilling out of the rolls!!! Don't come here to order rolls they can't tell if it's fully cooked! Looks like I will finding my new spot!","What a joke of a froyo shop!\n\nShame on you! One employee running the shift and they don't greet or are nice!\n\nNo tart flavor either!!!!\n\nNo no no!!","Basic soft serve ice cream with grocery store bought toppings that costs $7. In a city like Toronto that is big on food, there are many better ice cream options like Dutch dreams, Bang Bang Ice Cream or Sweet Olenka's.","No stars honestly. Worst DQ EVER. Customer service is just unbelievably sad. They don't even acknowledge you and they just seem so annoyed. Also, the wait is outrages for a drive thru. I waited 15 min for ONE small blizzard Just to be melted and I was the only one In line.","Not sure if I like their cupcakes. I was looking for delicious cupcake place since we love George town cupcake from DC. We really miss their cupcakes. This place is very small and have limited number of choices. I do not know how they make it, but it wasnt good at all. Only thing that was ok was red velvet. Considering these factors, the price was really high. Go to safeway instead, they have better? cupcakes with low price.","The food used to be good until they contracted out. Now it is horrible. The price have also gone up and portions have gotten smaller.","Arrived at 9:44 PM on Sunday, Nov 17th. The door was locked and the store was closed. Both the website and printed hours on the door state it closes at 10pm. Call ahead to find out what time they feel like closing or risk wasting your time.","There are very few flavor options here for milk teas! I was so disappointed! They do sell products that are beautiful and make for a great Instagram photo but that is the bottom line. If you want something good for a photo, go here. If you want something delicious and exciting, stay far away. \n\nTwo stars only because the seating area inside is big and the have lots of fun games to enjoy while you hang out. It is clean inside and the music is good.","I love the cupcakes but the girl working in the Awhatukee store today is the most miserable and unhelpful person I've dealt with.  It's like she doesn't want me to spend money in that store.","Everything is kind of sub-par, except the pizza which might be good enough to be average. Eh.","Had the pumpkin pie Ice cream. Ice Cream was a little watery and the pie crust was just bland. i think for the price they should be using better quality ingredients.","This place was over hyped. The green tea soft serve was good but I don't think it's worth $8-9 for a small cup and the line up was 30-40min wait and it get really crowded and cramped when you get inside as there it very little room to move. Seating was limited and there was trash all over the table and it was dirty.","Went there on a Sunday night, they said it would be a 20 min wait. We left. No apologies from the girl working there.","These drinks are really bland, nothing really drew me in. I tried like 6 drinks and all drinks were ok or decent. The ice cream Vietnamese coffee needs more flavor. More flavor!!! I'm sorry, I tried to give this place a chance after hearing all the great reviews but was very disappointed .","Not impressed! I tried this for the first time today and all I can say is the food is beyond bland. Healthy food does not need to be unseasoned. I had the Mediterranean bowl with tofu and the tofu was basically boiled without seasoning, quinoa was unseasoned, vegetables were mushy. I will not be returning back to this restaurant as it was a meal that was not worth 11 dollars!","First of all,when you enter this place it smells weird. And I will not recommend you guys to eat  any thing from this place.Because, the guy was cutting strawberries straight from packing without washing them with water and without using any gloves. And the manager is very rude toward his staff.","Overpriced! Pasta isn't that expensive.\nSauce is bland nothing special about it.\nNow the pizza-that's a winner! Best in the north hills.","It said they closed at 10, we walked in at 9:20 and the doors were locked. We politely asked if anyone was in there and a girl that worked there gave me a very dirty look and screamed \"ITS OPEN\" then rolled her eyes. I did not like the disrespect. Then we continued to get ice cream and while she was cleaning she sprayed water at us. Never going back.","Horrible customer service! I decided to try this place as it is literally the closest \"sushi\" spot from my work. I walked in and asked for the order I had placed over the phone, the hostess said \"ok\", then walked away and never returned. I ordered the volcano roll which was meh (no other word comes to mind). I ate it but can't say I enjoyed it. I won't be returning to Senor Sushi. What a waste of my lunch break.","Really unprofessional to run an advertisement that says $3 smoothies to come in and find out they're 2 for 10. \n\nThat equates to less than a dollar of savings per smoothie. I wouldn't have driven 6 miles for a smoothie if I hadn't heard this false advertisement. I heard the ad the same day I came in.\n\nPretty disappointing for a first time visit. Don't think I'll come back","$22 for 3 cones. Low quality gut bomb. It takes actual culinary skill to make ice cream flavors in the actual ice cream (i.e. Kerou, Bang bang) rather than just load cheap soft serve with dollarama candy. You just feel gross after eating it and all 3 of us threw it out when it was half over. \n\nComplete hipster trash - take your Instagram photo of your ironic Krusty cone and chuck that abomination out right after.","corn was super watery and over cooked. i wouldn't recommend getting the corn in a cup","Ive tried Sweet Republic a few times now because of all the hype. With all the amazing ice cream spots in Phoenix this one really misses the mark.  The flavors are bland, the waffle cones taste stale, and the topping selection is extremely limited.  Definitely wouldn't come back with all the other amazing options in the area.","This is the worse cold stone that I have been to, the employees are rude and non chalande and just couldn't follow directions. All I asked for was half and half and he couldn't do it right. Oh and he gave me a family size that was 3/4 full. Will never go back","Way too expensive and the wait after ordering is ridiculously long. My children waited 20 minutes for one strawberry shake that cost $8! Terrible experience. Waste of money, energy and time.","They only take cash. They do not have a children's size/price. They are expensive. If you do decide to splurge, you may find they are out of the flavor you want but it's too late because you pay first. Yes, it is delicious (although I think their gelato is too sweet), but customer service does not stop there. Oh, and their bathrooms are disgusting.","Let a line of 8 ppl build up with nobody at the register. No employee in sight. Somebody finally found a bell and they came out, but really 8 ppl?! I got a strawberry iced tea. Tasted like flowers.","They desperately need more hands on deck here. I order ahead and STILL end up waiting an extra 20 mins past my expected pick up time. That's only because no one acknowledged me or asks me why maybe I've been standing at the pickup counter for over 20 minutes. When I finally catch someone's attention they tell me they never got my order. I'm in the service industry, I get it you get backed up and things happen . But kind, great customer service goes A LONG WAY.","By the time they got the order right, the food was cold. Avoid this place until they hire a coherent staff.","Horrible, location looks dirty and wasn't even open. Checked the hours and came back twenty minutes after it opened and was still closed. Maps said that I was open but it wasn't. Wow Menchie's! Never coming to a Menchies again","The ice cream was good and the shop was clean but the reason for my review is that the loud music playing was extremely inappropriate. Rap music with lots of adult language and themes. There were other children there along with our 3 year old. I would have just thought it was a poor choice by an employee but read a similar review from three weeks ago. Management, what are you thinking? After about the 20th F bomb in 10 minutes we left.","TERRIBLE SERVICE! This place is dirty the guys working there don't know what hand hygiene is, they were not wearing gloves while preparing the food. All three of them were very rude. I won't be going back to this place for sure!","I found the portions quite small for all the dishes we ordered.   Food is decent but not out of this world and when you factor the price ($15-$16 for the dishes we ordered), the good atmosphere and service could not make this one of my go to places.  However the place is quite busy so I'm sure many people may dispute me.  Not saying it's a bad place but found it expensive for the food/portion size.","Finally tried Sweet Jesus at its newest location at Eglinton and Yonge. \n\nMust say that i don't believe it lives up to its hype. It's pre-designed, glorified soft serve ice cream that is super overpriced. Maybe when the hype dies down, and they allowed a more personalized option, it would be something to look into.","My wife and I ordered the same thing and they brought them 6 minutes apart. Had apple pie with ice cream. Ice cream was good. Large portions but for $14, I would expect better than microwave reheated pie. Makes the pastry soft. Probably won't return.","I order a banana split and there was confusion on that, when I asked for strawberry only. It's simple just strawberries. No pineapple or chocolate. When I got to the window the employee was preparing the banana split with no gloves. Disgusting. You are suppose to wear gloves when handling ready to eat food like the banana it's code!","The employees I encountered barely speak English. They were semi busy so it took a while to get my order in and the freakin thing didn't even come out any sort of correctly. I also realize that the carhops do not make regular minimum wage so i also tip. This is the first time that I absolutely refuse to. She didn't even bring a spoon for the sundae so my kid could start eating it while we had to wait for our food to come out at different times.","It's cute, it's clean, it's awesome when the weather is nice, the guy working when I went in cracked a joke or two. \n\nNo contest, sweetest frozen yogurt I've ever tried. Maybe that's a good thing if you're an ice cream junkie, but I missed the natural yogurty tang in the flavors and had to stick with plain ol' tart.","More like a packed stuff to go type of thing. No one to make desert for you. Buy, go home, and make it yourself I guess.","A little annoyed that I drove 30mins to try this place out and all they had was 5 flavors to choose from!? For the people that have to make a drive maybe you should call ahead, and see if they're serving more than 5 flavors or have waffles in stock. It was a waste of my time...","I grabbed a burger/tots from this location on 12/2/11 (I typically don't eat \"fast food\" but I was in a bind.)\n\nAbout 3am the following morning I was sick, I have spend the last 10 hours or so throwing up and cementing my ban on fast food.\n\nCustomer beware, nothing feel worse than food poisoning. This is not just upset stomach, it is full on horrible.","I have come to this location a few times now and every time I get a waffle bowl it is always so stale that it's chewy and not edible. I'm not sure why but if you're going to get a waffle cone or waffle bowl you may want to make sure that they are fresh.","I've never received a smaller scoop of ice cream than I did here. One usually expects a generous serving but that was not the case here. The treat itself was good but the portion was not.","Not a good experience at all!!! \nThe food is a overpriced, and not all that great! And alittle annoying that you get charged for every extra condiment you ask for, not to mention the server never mentioned the extra fees! the server was very distracted and really didnt deserve the automatic 18% gratuity!!","If I could put no stars I would.  The people were rude. My slushy was more like an icy and when I asked for it to be remade they went to the back and brought out the same drink. Never again","I'm very tough in grading just because I know quality and I know how my food should taste, fries are mushy not the best and the food in general doesn't look as appetizing as it does in the pictures way far from it, it barely had any lettuce the cheese isn't melted ? I mean I would prolly give it another chance with  another meal","Not what I was expecting. A tiny little store. Came here for the soft serve cereal milk ice cream which has to be ordered at the bottom of the stairs.\nA bit pricey at $14 for two small servings.\nAfter tasting it.... Not sure what others find so interesting. Have to say, I'm not a fan.","Place is only good for their shakes,malts, sundaes. Wish I'd known that before buying I got the chili burger, tasted nothing but meat, wasn't satisfied so I traded in for cheese burger, it was so tiny, my shake filled me up.\nIt's a cute vintage place but who doesn't sell fries?!?!?!!! But potato chips? Meh","Ordered 5 ice cream servings...very disappointing..very skimpy servings.. 31 degree \"blizzard\" knock off was just soft serve with a few bits of Reese...\nAVOIDE THIS PLACE","This rating is for their tea only. I have yet to taste the ice cream.\nOrdered a black iced tea and a matcha milk tea. Both were way too sweet! The milk in the matcha was almost as if they poured sugar straight into the bottle, then added more flavoring with more sugar! The black tea was practically like McDonald's sweet tea.","Jalepeno popper = delicious. Poutine = ok, but gravy was chunky. Pizza = awful, the ranch swirl took over the pizza. I couldn't even eat it, it was so sloppy and overpowering.","Get the White Chocolate but leave the Strawberries and Cream flavor, too faux-berry/chemical tasting.","Horrible service and soggy burger. Decided to try it and never again. The server was in a rush dropped mints in our car and pretty much threw our food at us. Seemed very nervous to even talk we couldn't even hear him. My husband actually was asking him the order to which he was holding. Also the credit card swipe wasn't working and asked to pay twice it was like he didn't even hear us...","Second time I go there and they mess up my order....asked for no onions on burger and got onions again....the sticker for no onion is even on there....bread was stale and quite frankly when I called to complain no one answered there phone....is rather pay at another place for better service and quality..","Looked everywhere for this place. And we walked in circles..... it's not there anymore! It was a huge disappointment so it should be taken off of this app. CLOSED!","4 staff working on a hot day with only 1 actively serving customers.  Other staff are either re-stocking ice cream (not a good plan while store is busy) or simply pretending to tidy.  For the money charged, I expect better service.  Location in Kierland didn't have this problem the last time I was there.","Over-priced, tiny portions of ice cream that tasted \"meh\". Disappointing considering other options nearby. Sorry but, I won't be back...","Waited 30+mins for a $9 sundae that was smaller than the size of a small coffee. The worker assembling it had no idea what was going on it took her like 5 mins to assemble it by then the ice cream had all melted so I paid $9 to eat melted ice cream. Bad.","Omg it's a fake! Not the same as the famous 喜茶 from China  even though they copied the cup and logo...Wow","Absolutely disgusting tables covered in mustard, broken sprinkle machine, and 2 flavors. \n\nWe probably won't be back.","Good ice cream but the pizza was just ok. Not terrible, but I'd take Vocelli or any other chain over it on any day.","Waited nearly twenty minutes to half an hour for an iced matcha specialty drink, likewise my companion waited the same for a slice of cake and a drink. Taste of the drink was pretty weak. The decor is nice but when you turn around and see the left behind dishes and cups it kinda ruins it. There aren't enough staff cleaning the tables. Place is good to look cute for Instagram photos but for an actual sweet treat you're better off going to Tsujiri for a dedicated matcha shop.","basically paying overpriced $13 for some fruits + cream + slush\n\nwhen I went they only has strawberries... the strawberries was sour and not sweet, there was too little cream, and a lot of slush at the bottom.\n\nthe line was long and moved very very slow.","Not my cup of Snoh. I tried the number 8; pistachio Snoh, pudding, caramel, and sliced almonds. The sliced almonds were the only thing I could taste. Everything else was bland and just tasted sweet. Too sweet that I couldn't finish my small cup.  Not worth the calorie consumption. Not sure I would go back.","Poor service and unknowledgeable staff. Did not know how to accept PayPal even though they advertise their acceptance within the PayPal app; unwilling to figure out how to accept it even though the checkout iPad was right there.","HORRIBLE!! Clueless about customer service and courtesy!\nThe owner of the company I work with was on the phone with this place at 9:50pm - he was on the way there with a tests for ice cream for his wife. He was on the phone with them and less than 3 minutes away when  manager got on the phone and told him \"You might as well turn around - we have to lock the door at 10.\"\nJust Bad...","Slow service...  Carside podiums are a bit run down. Otherwise it's a sonic.  Same food everywhere. Seems clean. Staff is friendly when they do answer the intercom or show up.","I'm giving this location a one star, because there is a line of about 7... and the gentleman working isn't helping the line... he is dealing/fulfilling online orders  thanks to the young lady for staying calm during a busy time and taking care of the line alone.","Literally the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to. It should not take 20+ minutes to get through a DRIVE THRU. I sat at the window for nearly 30 mins while the kids inside were messing and joking around. Apart from that, they can't make a correct order to save their lives. How hard is it to make a COOKIE DOUGH blizzard instead of an OREO? Perhaps get your ears checked or check with the customer to make sure you heard them correctly?","Horrible customer service. Drove here out of our way and arrived at 10pm, well before closing time posted online (11) and on the door (1130). Lady working just shook her head at us and wouldn't even make eye contact or offer an explanation as to why we had just driven 20 mins for nothing. Not coming back here.","Went to Snoh expecting a nice ice cream parlor. It was basically poorly flavored ice. Ice Cream is no part of this overpriced,  understaffed, poor location,  they were out of 95% of their toppings,  place was awful.  Flavorings were weak and uninspired.  There's no outdoor seating,  my family will never go to this whole in the ground again.  Save your money go to where real Ice Cream is served,  it's not at this miserable place.","We were really looking forward to The Screamery opening, so this is a hard review to post. The ice cream was very good. However, we walked out spending $8.70 for a very small child's scoop in a cone and a small single scoop in a cup. Our friends chose not to order after seeing the portion of ice cream that was served.  Needless to say, we won't be back.","I could pay $3 for a whole cartoon of walmart brand ice cream and its about the same. Not bad, but nothing special.  Went for The Flight, but was told NOT SERVING because manager trying to decide whether to charge more for it?? Really hard to find, sign really small and lots of construction. Wouldn't bother coming again...","The concept of this seems really cool. Unfortunately the execution is awful. I'm not sure how long this location has been open but it seems that training was rushed. Orders were behind (way behind) and after waiting about 20-25 minutes when we got our order for a group of 4 it wasn't accurate. This isn't an issue with the staff, it's clear they're doing the best they can they just lack leadership from the top.","Went to Retail me not... no deals. The advertised pattymelt states 3.99.\nBut that's the normal price. As a matter of fact. They have NO DEALS or coupons.","Great concept poorly executed.  They were out of so many things.  No cups for nitro shakes or water.  No straws.  No waffle cone pieces.  No whipped cream.  Yep.  No whipped cream at an ice cream place.","I came here this morning with my wife and I ordered the Toasted bacon sand which. It looked more like to warm pieces of bread that were very soggy and cheese. Where was the bacon? \nSeriously, you had one job. i was so upset i literally threw it out the window at a some pigeons that i seen. i would have went back but i could not be late to work. Def will not be returning.","Really wanted to love this place. Great atmosphere (outside) the inside, basic counter and not much more. Staff, awesome, the girls behind the counter could not have been better. The gelato? Meh, and 2 scoops of gelato for 9.00 (2 kids/one small scoop each)??? They either need to up their game or lower prices.","Service was very poor. They put the gelato flavors away as we were ordering and then we're rude when we asked to see if we couldn't get one of them back out of the fridge.\n\nGelato itself is more sugar than flavor","It's pretty good ice cream but they just raised their prices for $4.25 for a single scoop and $8.25 FOR 2 SCOOPS OF ICE CREAM lolol like it's pretty good but definitely not that good. The flavors are interesting but not worth that much.","Everything is nice except the girl who makes cones wasn't wearing gloves and has very long nails. They should wear gloves when in direct contact with food!!! This is disgusting.","The interior was clean, and the ice-cream themselves were very instagrammable. Personally, I have a major sweet tooth, but even I found the ice-cream from Fugo Desserts to be overwhelmingly sweet. It's not for me!","No hot fudge, really, ice cream store and no hot fudge??? My wife had coffee ice cream, old and icy. Not fresh. No one in store. I understand why. Very pricey too. They could have opened a jar of hot fudge which they sell.","DON'T GO HERE. we went here and the man was so overbearing, we just wanted some yogurt? i asked for a sample cup and he personally walked with me and watched me sample the yogurt LOL.. then i used the same sample cup to sample another flavor and he scolded me!! he said \"don't use the same cup. be careful.\" it's not the TSA relax \nAND, the candy was aaaalll stale... and the yogurt sucked","Sat in drive-thru for about 10 minutes and no one assisted with my order. This is about the 5th time it has happened to me at this location where they completely ignore cars in drive-thru.","This was the worst experience. The milk tea is extremely sweet and the tea (lightbulb) wasn't great as I expected. The customer service was sucked, I waited to long to got an order, but it wasn't the right one. I paid twice for one order","It was fun to be in the pool cafe as the furniture and decorations are cool.  But the ice cream is not worth $5 and they are charging way more then that!  I can see this place is a tourist trap as they care more about getting you in the door then giving you good food (ice cream).  I recommend you walk in talk a selfie and run.","It looks good but it tastes bitter. \nThe shop assistant told me this cup of things is like this（hard to drink）","I think the price for adults menu is expensive, I wasn't thrill with the hot dog. The antiques are ok but again I think they are expensive. However, the customer service was good.","Milkshakes taste good, not great. They really make you feel gross after though. The service was so-so; they were somewhat passive aggressive -- the cashier asked if I knew of any parties to go to after his shift as well? Good place if you want an instagram picture of your milkshake, but if you're looking for a decent milkshake you're better off going to McDonalds. Probably won't be back again.","Honestly this is such basic boba. For the price and flavor I wasnt very impressed. I got the classic milk tea with tapioca pearls. When I was drinking it nothing stood out for me. I would say the pearls are correctly done, but that's all I can say. It was so typical. Nothing special.","Ice cream is good but way too expensive I don't want to pay eight dollars for a damn sundae, Plus the line is way too long and out the door. The place is cute but really small. Wouldn't recommend.","Expensive $10.50 for fresas con crema with extra crema . The taSte was good , they only put like 4 pecans half pieces.. no coconut.","Sooooooo slooooooowwwwwww. It's actually painful to watch. There is zero energy or motivation to get anything done. The milkshakes are really good and I love that they have vegan options but it is really annoying how long it takes for them to make the shakes. My first time there the kid handed me a milkshake with chocolate smeared all over the outside of the cup. Maybe some training or closer supervision would improve things.","Overrated and overhyped hipster spot.  I would take Costco ice cream over anything from SJ all day.","The serve at this location was poor. By the time we got our bowls and ice cream it was closing time (which I did not know) and they said we could not sit down and eat our bowls so we had to leave. The staff still had to clean yet they asked us to leave. I feel that is horrible serve on top of that the ice cream was melted.","Not really flavorful chucherias place. The corn in the cup was not good at all. Their fresas con crema were good. Their tostilocos were okay. Their prices are fair. The waffle taco was alright nothing extraordinary :/","Expect HORRIBLE service and an hour wait for your food! Have gone a couple times hoping to get a better treatment and its just worse each time! The food is okey. I would rather go to any other sushi place where they appreciate their costumers!","Terrible service!\n\nThe food is so mediocre and although the decor is fun and playful, if you like long waits, and disappointing slow service were they forget what you ordered, can't get their attention and don't give you cutlery this is the place for you. The hype is not worth it.","The Pizza is above average for Pittsburgh but that is not saying much for Pittsburgh pizza.  It does not even compare to pizza from New York or Chicago but takes a close second to a DiGiorno pizza.","The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because it is literally on the water with a patio. Go for drinks and enjoy the ambience. The fried chicken has very little flavor and the sides (we ordered all of them) were not memorable or enjoyable. The service was fine.","Delicious ice cream!  Nice family owned business. Great variety and always a surprise flavor.","I tried twice at this place. There is a difference in cultures here with the owner. My experiences are the same as the other reviewers. Don't go! You'll thank me later.","After a lazy, post 5k run Saturday I wanted a quick frozen treat.  Came here and got.....freezer burned ice cream.  \n\n\"Meh.\"","Garbage service. If you want attitude and your bill thrown at you after waiting an hour( and it's not even busy) for a plain pizza and a couple of hoagies that are cold - then this is your spot. Unbelievable.","Ordered the Thai tea soft serve, received rude condescending service and cone with icy, bland, soft serve.\n\nMy friend got the cookie monster, said it was just okay.\n\nWe came here because of the rave reviews and because my friend kept telling us to come here to support his friend, but I really don't get the hype and will not be returning.","You get a zero this is by far the worst chocolat place i have had in canada their hot chocolat and drinking chocolat is comparable to dollarstore packaged stuff they served me soup if you ask for creme in your hot chocolat they do not have it only milk looks like many corners are being cut or people from toronto do not have a clue what hot chocolat and or drinking chocolat is supposed to taste like","The ice cream is so inconsistent. The last time I went half my cup was soup before I left the shop. The rest can best be described as wallpaper paste. \n\nTook 15 minutes to get it too because they were understaffed and weren't cleaning the equipment quickly enough. \n\nSadly, this was there second chance from and it will be my last.","This place, now under new ownership and called drip has terrible costumer service, prices went up and the attendants are rude to the point of closing and locking the door early as we are stepping out of our car (parking directly in front). Previous owners were passionate about water and their high grade filtration, while these people make me not  want to go back at all.","Is there 0 stars, please?\n\nWe placed a bulk order to bring treats for our team, scheduled time to go pick up, and upon arriving the staff at Fugo shared \"our donut machines are broken\".\n\nThere were no calls or emails to inform us about this issue to save us the trip, even worse when they finally refunded the order it was without an apology.\n\nWay to win customers.","I drove by and saw a sign for a new Philly Cheese steak that looked great so I decided to give it a try.  Boy was I bait and switched with poor representation of of what was on the sign.  It looked barely edible but I gave it a try anyways..  yup barely edible... steak was awful, bread was dry as a dog biscuit and an insane amount of Mayo!","Was very disappointing. We were so looking forward to Ritas. We had not been to this location and most likely will not do so again. The staff, however was great!","Although all the the Tim Hortons are managed by the same kind of people and there is no Tim Hortons in the city which we can say yeah this is the best one.\nThis specific Tim Hortons is one of the worse places I visited. I waited for 15 mins just to pick up my coffee and they didn't even put sugar in that.\nVery weak service \nNo cleanliness \nNo customer service \nNo ethics","I brought the family to try this spot because of all the positive reviews but I was extremely disappointed in the quality. Staff was great and the atmosphere welcoming but that didn't make up for the lack in flavor. We ordered the coconut and pistachio flavors both tasted like water, the only thing good about them was the toppings. Maybe we chose the wrong flavors ? Either way this place left a bad first impression on us. We won't be returning.","Oh my god are you serious?? This is the worst sonic drive in in the United States.  Hands down.  Worst service every single time.  Every single time I come to this location I completely regret it. Unreal.","Worst yogurty's ever. Flavours watered down, 1/2 as many toppings as other stores, 1/2 the machines out of order. Terrible","I love ice cream, especially soft serve. That's why I'm so disappointed in Sweet Jesus. The vanilla soft serve has a terrible taste and texture. The waffle cone has no taste. The red velvet pieces on the red rapture also tasted bad. I didn't even finish it.  And ice cream is my thing!!  It really says a lot that I threw it away.  Would not return.","Fun atmosphere good drinks. But we wait so long every time we come here. 15 minutes for an iced drink? Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Wish they were a bit faster so it could be an in and out drink shop.","The food is way too expensive two burgers fries and milkshakes $25.00 for just mediocre thin patty burgers and wrinkle fries","Ordered burger with no pickles and no tomatoes. Sure enough I get home and there's pickles and tomatoes. This place is was too overpriced for the quality and quantity.","Got her right at 10 there was 2 people in line and 2 tables eating ice cream and one of the girls turned me away in a rude way, never goona come back.","Would love to give this place a higher review because their boba and thai tea are the best in town. But service weighs more to me than the taste. The owner is unpleasant, rude and does not treat his regulars or even customers with respect."]},"ATTR546":{"id":"ATTR546","name":"rating","_cid":"id:E2uV_DRjK2U7huIX","clientKey":"","description":"","precision":2,"deleteable":true,"editable":true,"values":["positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","positive","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative","negative
